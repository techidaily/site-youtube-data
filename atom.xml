If you want the viewers to focus on a certain part of the video frame, apply the Pan &amp; Zoom feature.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add audio, texts, and more effects.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-2.png"                      alt="add text effects filmora"                ></p><p>Now that you have edited your different video shots into a single video, you can now take the step of adding some more effects to your video. At this point, you can add different staff such as music, texts, and different other effects that you would prefer your viewers to see in your video. Some may think this is difficult to do if they have not tried it before.</p><p>The Wondershare Filmora screen editor has appropriate features to help you add all the effect you need without wasting time at all.

The microphones in this list will be plug-and-plays, and you will only need the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >basic audio recording skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get started.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Prices are subjected to change.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-20"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-20" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $20"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $20</strong></h2><h4 id="BOYA-BY-M1-16-99"><a href="#BOYA-BY-M1-16-99" class="headerlink" title="BOYA BY-M1 - $16.99"></a><strong>BOYA BY-M1 - $16.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BOYA-Microphone-Windscreen-Windshield-Smartphones/dp/B01M2VC8GF/" >BOYA BY-M1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a lavalier microphone (a hand-free mic that clips onto your clothing) that connects to smartphones, DSLR, computers, and other audio recorders.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/boya-by-m1.jpg"                      alt="boya-by-m1"                ></p><p><strong>Pro</strong>: As an omnidirectional condenser microphone, it will be able to pick up audio from 360 degrees, and with 20 feet (6 meters) of cable, you can have a significant range movement even if you are connected to the camera.</p><p>The BOYA BY-M1 is a terrific choice for YouTubers on a budget that is frequently making videos on the go. It’s easy to carry around, and the ability to simply connect to a smartphone means you can set up and shoot your video on the fly.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: This mic, although it has a great range, can also pick up subtle movements you make as it is clipped onto you. Not great if there is a lot of action in your videos.</p><h4 id="TONOR-PC-Microphone-Computer-Condenser-15-99"><a href="#TONOR-PC-Microphone-Computer-Condenser-15-99" class="headerlink" title="TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99"></a><strong>TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TONOR-Microphone-Condenser-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B01142EPO4/" >TONOR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is an easy-to-setup condenser microphone that you can connect to your computer via USB and start recording in seconds.</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser.jpg"                      alt="tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser"                ></strong></p><p> <strong>Pro:</strong> The value of this microphone is in its ease of use. With a flexible, foldable stand, you can adjust the TONOR PC microphone the way it suits your setup. The legs of the stand are retractable, which makes it easy for you to store. If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it won’t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isn’t a wide range. It’s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $50"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $50</strong></h2><h4 id="Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99"><a href="#Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99" class="headerlink" title="Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99"></a><strong>Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras.

It doesn’t require any battery and is powered by whatever device it is plugged into, which is great for YouTubers with already so many devices to keep charged.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Much like the BOYA BY-M1, the Purple Panda, as it is clipped onto your lapel or shirt collar, will capture the sound of your clothes brushing against it if too much movement occurs.</p><h4 id="Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73"><a href="#Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73" class="headerlink" title="Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73"></a><strong>Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42" >Samson Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> microphone is the kind of mic that can fit in your pocket and be taken with you anywhere.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone.jpg"                      alt="samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has both a cardioid and an omnidirectional mode. This means that you can choose to have your microphone focused more on the subject speaking by switching to cardio or switch to Omni-directional to capture audio from the entire surrounding.</p><p>It is designed to be able to clip onto a flat surface such as your computer screen. This allows you to place the microphone on different levels to record.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Because of its unique design and the portability of the device, it will suffer wear-and-tear faster. Attention to storage is necessary to increase the lifespan of the device.</p><h4 id="XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99"><a href="#XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99" class="headerlink" title="XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99"></a><strong>XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99</strong></h4><p>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Condenser-Microphone-Recording-XIAOKOA/dp/B074GZJ4RP/" >XIAOKOA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>portable mini condenser microphone is compatible with smartphones, computers, and any devices using 3.5mm recording jacks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand.jpg"                      alt="xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> With a cardioid pickup, this condenser microphone will do a fine job picking up vocals. If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video. This feature can be problematic, as it could spoil your recording.</p><h4 id="TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93"><a href="#TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93" class="headerlink" title="TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93"></a><strong>TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a condenser microphone, and it can be fixed onto your camera, which simplifies your YouTube setup. This camera can plug directly into your camera, reducing the audio tracks you need to manage when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/takstar-sgc-598.jpg"                      alt="takstar-sgc-598"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The camera-mounted microphone has a shock-resistant design that reduces noise when the camera is moved. The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so you’ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.</p><p>Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.</p><p>The design requires it to be mounted to the camera. If you want to separate it from the camera and still have it recorded, a bit of creativity is required to keep it standing.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $100"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $100</strong></h2><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="Behringer-C-1U-59-99"><a href="#Behringer-C-1U-59-99" class="headerlink" title="Behringer C-1U - $59.99"></a><strong>Behringer C-1U - $59.99</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1U-BEHRINGER/dp/B001QXCYZY/" >Behringer C-1U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/behringer-c-1u.jpg"                      alt="behringer-c-1u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has a solid metal build and has a good weight. It is quick and easy to set up and is a good microphone for anyone wanting a simple solution for better audio on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> A pop filter is recommended for this microphone as it picks up a lot of popping sounds when the subject speaks.</p><h4 id="Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-64-94"><a href="#Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-64-94" class="headerlink" title="Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94"></a><strong>Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Versatile-Microphone/dp/B01L5U4WBQ" >Blue Microphones Snowball iCE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a cardioid condenser microphone that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/blue-microphones-snowball-ice.jpg"                      alt="blue-microphones-snowball-ice"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The Snowball iCE is a plug-and-play microphone that is super easy to use and doesn’t require any additional battery. Simply connect it to the computer, and you are ready to record your voice. It captures clear and crisp audio for a single voice or single-person recording.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The range of this microphone is not that great; you’ll have to be close and be speaking directly into the microphone to get the best audio. It is not ideal for recording moving subjects or those who are further than 2-3 feet away.</p><h4 id="Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-57-06"><a href="#Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-57-06" class="headerlink" title="Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06"></a><strong>Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a condenser microphone that records in a cardioid polar pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/marantz-professional-mpm-1000u.jpg"                      alt="marantz-professional-mpm-1000u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro</strong>: This budget microphone has excellent all-metal construction. It has a plug-and-play setup and doesn’t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.</p><p>If your YouTube videos consist of you in a quiet studio environment, I would recommend the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>However, if you will be recording on the go and require your hands to be free in the scene, I recommend getting a lavalier microphone such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But, if you are going to be recording other people, in addition to yourself, I’d say go with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it will give you more audio control in busy environments.</p><p>What are you looking for in a budget microphone?

Your outro, or end screen, on YouTube is your last chance to keep viewers on your channel. This can help you increase your channel’s watch time and get your videos ranked higher in search results.</p><p>Here are 6 outro maker sites where you can get outros and end cards. Check the bottom for our #1 pick!</p><blockquote><ul><li><a href="#outromaker">Outro Maker</a></li><li><a href="#biteable">Biteable</a></li><li><a href="#tubearsenal">Tube Arsenal</a></li><li><a href="#renderforest">Renderforest</a></li><li><a href="#Panzoid">Panzoid</a></li><li><a href="#introcave">Intro Cave</a></li><li><a href="#one">The #1 Pick!</a></li><li><a href="#filmora">Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="6-YouTube-Outro-Makers-With-Templates"><a href="#6-YouTube-Outro-Makers-With-Templates" class="headerlink" title="6 YouTube Outro Makers With Templates"></a>6 YouTube Outro Makers With Templates</h2><p>For even more End Screen Templates, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-youtube-end-screen-templates%21-plus%3B-how-to-build-your-301.html" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="1-Outro-Maker"><a href="#1-Outro-Maker" class="headerlink" title="1. Outro Maker"></a>1. Outro Maker</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost.</em></p><p>On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.</p><p>Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.</p><h4 id="2-Biteable"><a href="#2-Biteable" class="headerlink" title="2. Biteable"></a>2. Biteable</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free.</em></p><p>Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.</p><p>This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.</p><h4 id="3-Tube-Arsenal"><a href="#3-Tube-Arsenal" class="headerlink" title="3. Tube Arsenal"></a>3. Tube Arsenal</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10.</em></p><p>Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates&#x2F;end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors&#x2F;logo&#x2F;images. They have template cards with slots for videos&#x2F;playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.</p><p>Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).</p><h4 id="4-Renderforest"><a href="#4-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="4. Renderforest"></a>4. Renderforest</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros.</em></p><p>Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.</p><p>One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.</p><h4 id="5-Panzoid"><a href="#5-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="5. Panzoid"></a>5. Panzoid</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text.</em></p><p>Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).</p><h4 id="6-Intro-Cave"><a href="#6-Intro-Cave" class="headerlink" title="6. Intro Cave"></a>6. Intro Cave</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave.</em></p><p>As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.</p><p>Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Outro Maker Alternative- Wondershare Filmora"></a>YouTube Outro Maker Alternative- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a great video editor for all creators. It has a large collection of video transitions, filters, overlays and text templates which can also help you customize your own templates. And its intuitive interface and easy-to-use editing tools will make your editing more efficient and quick!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Quick-Guide-to-Correcting-Hidden-Shorts-on-YouTube"><a href="#Quick-Guide-to-Correcting-Hidden-Shorts-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Quick Guide to Correcting Hidden Shorts on YouTube"></a>Quick Guide to Correcting Hidden Shorts on YouTube</h2><p>Video thumbnails are important since they encourage people to click and watch the video. But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop.

Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done.

How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5.

An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views.

The apps listed above help you in this, and you can easily prepare attractive and engaging short clips pretty quickly using any of them. However, the most recommended, widely used, and the much-appreciated program is Wondershare Filmora that is not merely limited to mobile application-level features, it even has tools that usually compete with those available in the desktop software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/d-the-best-7-android-adblockers-for-screen-freedom/"><u>Ranked  The Best 7 Android AdBlockers for Screen Freedom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-steps-youtube-takes-once-a-video-is-submitted-for-viewing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Steps YouTube Takes Once a Video Is Submitted for Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/buy-top-10-gaming-gpus-for-high-quality-online-viewing-for-2024/"><u>Best Buy  Top 10 Gaming GPUs for High-Quality Online Viewing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/eading-list-of-16-youtube-openers-for-audience-expansion/"><u>[New] Leading List of 16 YouTube Openers for Audience Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-decoding-youtubes-mystery-a-sequential-exploration-guide/"><u>In 2024, Decoding YouTube's Mystery  A Sequential Exploration Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-converting-in-meeting-google-meet-to-youtube-broadcasts-your-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Converting In-Meeting Google Meet to YouTube Broadcasts  Your Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-guerrilla-marketing-for-youtube-upping-video-traffic/"><u>[New] In 2024, Guerrilla Marketing for YouTube  Upping Video Traffic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/reimagining-teams-background-beforeafter-conversations-for-2024/"><u>Reimagining Teams' Background Before/After Conversations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-messages-from-galaxy-a05s-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Messages from Galaxy A05s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-speed-tutorial-changing-photos-into-engaging-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] Speed Tutorial  Changing Photos Into Engaging YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-easy-ways-to-create-procreate-gifs/"><u>Updated In 2024, Easy Ways to Create Procreate GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-silence-to-significance-replying-in-discord-chats/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Silence to Significance  Replying in Discord Chats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-tecno-pop-7-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Tecno Pop 7 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/process-of-screen-sharing-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-to-pc-detailed-steps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Process of Screen Sharing Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to PC- Detailed Steps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-guide-vivo-t2-5g-wireless-and-wired-screen-mirroring-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Guide Vivo T2 5G Wireless and Wired Screen Mirroring | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.</p><p>When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >running a successful YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth. So, as a YouTube creator, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html" >growing your subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should definitely be a top priority.</p><p>There are many tips out there on how to go about <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-top-10-smartest-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-311.html" >increasing your YouTube subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.</p><ol><li><a href="#links"><strong>Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#sort">Sort Your Videos Into Playlists</a></strong></li><li><a href="#trailer"><strong>Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video</strong></a></li><li><a href="#rivals"><strong>Add Your Rivals To Your Tags</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS"><a href="#1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS" class="headerlink" title="1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly. And in addition, the more you are seen to create content that’s similar to the best videos, the more viewers are likely to subscribe to your channel.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2><p>The tips on this list are simple, straightforward, and sure to deliver results. If you want a YouTube subscriber boost, you’d better be smart about it!

Ryan Kaji (YouTube Channel: Ryan’s World)</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $29.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 41.7 million</p><p>Is it unbelievable that the richest YouTubers in 2024 is a nine-year-old boy?</p><p>Ryan Kaji, whose YouTube channel name is Ryan’s world, managed to get 30 million subscribers in over five years and is one of the most successful kid YouTubers. Just as he wrote in his bio - Ryan is crazy about doing lots of funny things like pretend play, science experiments, music videos, skits, challenges, DIY arts and crafts, and more! Ryan turned his hobbies into creative educational videos, which inspired millions of children.</p><h4 id="2-Mr-Beast-Jimmy-Donaldson"><a href="#2-Mr-Beast-Jimmy-Donaldson" class="headerlink" title="2.

Mr. Beast (Jimmy Donaldson)</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $24 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 47.8 million</p><p>Despite having 7 million more subscribers than the Ryan’s World channel, Donaldson’s fortune is currently 5.5 million short of being the largest among YouTubers. As YouTube’s biggest new star, it is still stunning enough for almost 50 million subscribers. As a matter of fact, his ambition is far more than that - 100 million subscribers and 3 billion views during 2021.</p><p>His videos combine stunts and humor. In the past half a year, Jimmy experienced prison life, built the largest Lego Tower in the world, sit in a tub of snakes for $10,000, etc. No one would deny all these incredible videos.</p><h4 id="3-Dude-Perfect"><a href="#3-Dude-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="3.

Dude Perfect</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $14 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 43 million</p><p>The Dude Perfect group has 5 members, and the Cotton twins Cory and Coby are the core of this team, but their three high school friends have been a part of the project from the beginning. Besides running one of the most subscribed channels on YouTube the Dude Perfect crew also has their own mobile app just named Dude Perfect which is available on iOS and Android. And they have built a partnership with Nickelodeon and have a TV show called The Dude Perfect Show.</p><p>Most of their YouTube videos are centered around sports activities and they all contain elements of comedy that have significantly contributed to the popularity of the Dude Perfect YouTube channel, and most of their videos are sponsored. The fact that their videos often feature professional athletes and celebrities such as Tyreke Evans, Johnny Manziel, or Tim McGraw also contributed to the swift success of the crew.</p><h4 id="4-Mark-Edward-Fischbach-YouTube-Channel-Markiplier"><a href="#4-Mark-Edward-Fischbach-YouTube-Channel-Markiplier" class="headerlink" title="4. Mark Edward Fischbach (YouTube Channel: Markiplier)"></a>4. Mark Edward Fischbach (YouTube Channel: Markiplier)</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $12.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 23 million</p><p>Yet another gaming video producer made his way to the list of top ten richest YouTube superstars. Mark Fischbach mostly produces LetsPlay videos and is known for his over-the-top commentary style that often involves yelling or cursing.</p><p>Mark likes indie and horror video games and for that reason most videos on his Markiplier YouTube channel cover games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Slender: The Eight Pages. In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers in 2021, Mark is also a voice actor who appeared on several TV shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Logan Paul"></a>5. Logan Paul</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $12.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 19 million</p><p>The vlogger who caught the public eye with the recent Japanese suicide incident hasn’t lost much of his YouTube subscribers despite his controversial behavior. As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.</p><p>His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.</p><h4 id="6-Felix-Arvid-Ulf-Kjellberg-YouTube-Channel-PewDiePie"><a href="#6-Felix-Arvid-Ulf-Kjellberg-YouTube-Channel-PewDiePie" class="headerlink" title="6. Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (YouTube Channel: PewDiePie)"></a>6. Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (YouTube Channel: PewDiePie)</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $12.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong>  96 million</p><p>Felix Kjellberg is the owner of the most subscribed channel on YouTube and he is only 28 years old. The Swedish gaming commentator is probably one of the richest Internet celebrities because his net worth is estimated at between $30 and $50 million.</p><p>However, he seems to be past his prime, and for the second straight year, Felix’s annual income is declining. Aside from the work he’s done in the realm of gaming, the world’s most popular YouTuber has also published a book that sold more than 112,00 copies and he hosted a web series on YouTube Red titled Scare PewDiePie.</p><h4 id="7-Jake-Paul"><a href="#7-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="7. Jake Paul"></a>7. Jake Paul</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $11.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 19 million</p><p>Jake Paul is Logan Paul’s younger brother, who is an actor, a musician, and a YouTube video producer who first gained recognition on Vine. He’s been on YouTube since 2013, and in the subsequent years, videos on his channel collected over 4 billion views.</p><p>His song ‘It’s Everyday Bro’ was released on May 30. 2017 had 70 million views in a single month, but it later went on to become the third most disliked video on YouTube. Jake is only 22 and if he manages to avoid scandals and controversy he may stay among the richest YouTubers for the years to come.</p><h4 id="8-Daniel-Middleton-YouTube-Channel-DanTDM"><a href="#8-Daniel-Middleton-YouTube-Channel-DanTDM" class="headerlink" title="8. Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)"></a>8. Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $11 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 19 million</p><p>Who said that gaming is a waste of time? Currently, the richest man on YouTube gaming channel has made his fortune on Minecraft videos, although Daniel Middleton, the owner of the most profitable channel on YouTube has also had quite a bit of success outside of the platform.</p><p>Daniel is from the United Kingdom and this British guy who was born in 1991 has published several comic books and starred in a number of TV shows (such as Skylanders Academy) and a YouTube Red Series, but the majority of his income still comes from the views he gets on his Minecraft videos, including gaming sponsorships and merchandise. He even has a second channel called MoreTDM though which was not active in recent years.</p><h4 id="9-Smosh"><a href="#9-Smosh" class="headerlink" title="9. Smosh"></a>9. Smosh</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $11 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 24 million</p><p>This is by far the oldest YouTube channel on this list since the duo of slapstick comedians Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla joined the platform back in 2005. Over the years they have produced some iconic video-game music videos and parodies.</p><p>Smosh also has a number of ongoing web series that have attracted nearly 7 billion views and they have won numerous awards. In 2015 Smoosh: The Movie, was released, featuring Hecox and Padilla as themselves, but the film received only mild critical acclaim. Anthony Padilla stopped working on Smosh videos and started his own YouTube channel in 2017.</p><h4 id="10-Lilly-Singh-YouTube-Channel-IISuperwomanII"><a href="#10-Lilly-Singh-YouTube-Channel-IISuperwomanII" class="headerlink" title="10. Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)"></a>10. Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $10.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 14 million</p><p>The Canadian vlogger, comedy video producer, and singer Lilly Singh is the face behind an enormously popular YouTube channel called Superwoman. There is very little doubt that Lilly is indeed a superwoman because in 2021 her estimated earnings will surpass the $10 million mark.</p><p>This incredibly talented and beautiful Canadian has been producing YouTube videos since 2010, her videos have collected over 2 billion views. In addition to being a YouTube superstar, Lilly has also made appearances in feature films like Dr. Cabbie, Fahrenheit 451, or Bad Moms., to mention a few. Hopefully, her acting career will be as successful as her YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Young stars are born every day, but reaching the heights of the top ten highest-paid YouTubers requires patience, hard work, and most of all a stroke of luck. The world’s largest video-sharing platform offers great opportunities for young people who want to share their skills, thoughts, and ideas with the rest of the world, but it also demands a lot of creativity and dedication.

So, give Filmora a try and become surprised by how easy it is to create a high-quality YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/op-5-multimedia-sensation-apps-iphoneandroid-showdown/"><u>[New] Top 5 Multimedia Sensation Apps  IPhone/Android Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-best-value-for-money-11-no-cost-name-creation-tips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Best Value for Money  11 No-Cost Name Creation Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ccess-exclusive-stock-images-through-vital-4-youtube-sources/"><u>[New] Access Exclusive Stock Images Through Vital 4 YouTube Sources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-rapid-growth-recipe-for-youtube-from-thousands-to-millions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Rapid Growth Recipe for YouTube  From Thousands to Millions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-maximizing-audience-engagement-with-youtube-shorts-templates/"><u>In 2024, Maximizing Audience Engagement with YouTube Shorts Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-easy-and-fast-convert-youtube-music-into-mp3-mac-version/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Easy & Fast  Convert YouTube Music Into MP3, Mac Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-how-to-upload-a-video-from-imovie-to-youtube/"><u>[Updated] How to Upload a Video From iMovie to YouTube?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ioneering-creativity-youtubes-playground-for-talent-for-2024/"><u>[New] Pioneering Creativity  YouTube's Playground for Talent for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-battle-for-video-editing-supremacy-sony-vegas-pro-vs-adobe-premiere-pro/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Battle for Video Editing Supremacy Sony Vegas Pro vs Adobe Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gif-magic-transformations-without-extra-files-downloaded/"><u>2024 Approved  GIF Magic  Transformations Without Extra Files Downloaded</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-precision-and-power-top-5-text-plugins-for-after-effects-creativity/"><u>[New] In 2024, Precision and Power  Top 5 Text Plugins for After Effects Creativity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-vivacut-analysis-and-editors-blueprint-for-2024/"><u>Comprehensive VivaCut Analysis & Editor's Blueprint for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elitepixel-recorder-winos-series/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  ElitePixel Recorder WinOS Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/15-indispentic-tools-to-launch-your-youtube-career-for-2024/"><u>15 Indispentic Tools to Launch Your YouTube Career for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-fine-tune-your-snaps-with-mac-produced-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] Fine-Tune Your Snaps with Mac-Produced Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/visualverve-tips-for-resizing-images-in-instagram-for-2024/"><u>VisualVerve  Tips for Resizing Images in Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-supreme-storytelling-spanning-eight-movie-types/"><u>[Updated] Supreme Storytelling Spanning Eight Movie Types</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You might have also watched some videos from influencers telling you that the ruthless YouTube algorithm demands daily content if you aspire to grow an audience.</p><p>There are many reasons why you may want to try your hand at becoming a daily vlogger, but here are 3 motivating reasons to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >conquer your vlogging fears <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and get started.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Vlogging is an art and people use vlogging to upload videos daily to their YouTube channel. This is natural if you are recording videos daily, you will need a tool like Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos with precision. To make your task easy, Wondershare Filmora has all the features and effects that are required to edit a daily vlog video that you can upload directly from Filmora itself. You can make use of features like add text, background music, filters &amp; effects, etc if you are a daily vlogger as it would help you a lot in making the video look professional in less time.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p><p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p><p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p><h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p><p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p><h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p><h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content"><a href="#6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content"></a><strong>6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p><h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p><h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p><p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p><h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p><h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p><h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p><h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p><p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p><p><em>Are you thinking of starting your daily vlog?

Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record"></a><strong>1. Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record</strong></h3><p>When you’re recording audio, you have to be more aware of the subtle sounds that drone on in your background. These sounds may include humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, and jingling from your pet’s collar. Observe your recording space and find ways to silence everything that you don’t want in your audio recording.</p><h3 id="2-Put-your-mobile-phone-in-airplane-mode"><a href="#2-Put-your-mobile-phone-in-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode"></a><strong>2. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode</strong></h3><p>Although it may be quite obvious to turn your phone’s ring tone off when you’re recording, it may not be as obvious to put your phone in airplane mode. When phones receive calls or perform searches as part of their background processes, they emit signals that can get picked up by your recording system. Avoid ruining good takes with unwanted sounds of phone signals by putting your phones in airplane mode.</p><h3 id="3-Minimize-echo"><a href="#3-Minimize-echo" class="headerlink" title="3. Minimize echo"></a><strong>3. Minimize echo</strong></h3><p>If you are recording yourself talk or sing, make sure to set up your recording space in a way where the sound projected from your voice bounces minimally off the walls and back to your microphone. Bare walls and hardwood floors will cause a lot of bouncing. Make use of materials that will absorb your sound rather than bounce it, like a thick rug or a comforter. If you want your voice to echo, that’s something you should do in post-production.</p><h3 id="4-Block-wind-from-reaching-your-microphone"><a href="#4-Block-wind-from-reaching-your-microphone" class="headerlink" title="4. Block wind from reaching your microphone"></a><strong>4. Block wind from reaching your microphone</strong></h3><p>Although it might not sound so loud and distracting to the naked ear, wind sounds terribly loud through a microphone recording and can cause your audio to clip (distortion of waveform due to output of sound exceeding maximum capacity or 0 dB point). This includes the “wind” that comes out of your mouth when you pronounce words starting with the letter “p.” Use pop filters, windscreens, and deadcats to block wind from reaching your microphone.</p><h3 id="5-Upgrade-your-microphone"><a href="#5-Upgrade-your-microphone" class="headerlink" title="5. Upgrade your microphone"></a><strong>5. Upgrade your microphone</strong></h3><p>As much as you try to control all the noise in your surroundings, your greatest recording limitation will come from the hardware that you use. Improve your recordings by plugging in an external microphone into your camera’s microphone jack or record audio completely separately with a professional microphone.</p><p>Need help with deciding on a microphone to buy? Check out our recommended list of microphones.</p><h3 id="6-Adjust-your-levels"><a href="#6-Adjust-your-levels" class="headerlink" title="6. Adjust your levels"></a><strong>6. Adjust your levels</strong></h3><p>Before pressing the record button, see how loudly your microphone picks up the sound you wish to record. Adjust your levels (sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound sits in between -6 dBs and -12dBs. This range gives the source of your sound some room to get louder without the recorded audio getting clipped. When you first listen to audio recorded within this range, it may sound very quiet. No need to worry though because you can increase the volume later in editing.</p><h3 id="7-Start-with-a-sound-cue-if-you’re-planning-to-do-some-syncing-in-post"><a href="#7-Start-with-a-sound-cue-if-you’re-planning-to-do-some-syncing-in-post" class="headerlink" title="7. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post"></a><strong>7. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post</strong></h3><p>If you’re recording separate audio that you plan to sync to your video later in editing, start your recording with a short and loud sound cue like a clap or a high pitched “beep” tone. Later, when you’re editing, it’ll be much easier for you to find the section where your video and additional audio match.</p><h3 id="8-Get-close-to-the-sound"><a href="#8-Get-close-to-the-sound" class="headerlink" title="8. Get close to the sound"></a><strong>8. Get close to the sound</strong></h3><p>Unless you’re aiming to record ambient sound, bring your microphone close to the source of sound you are wanting to record. The closer your microphone is to the source of sound, the lower your sensitivity setting can be on your microphone. As a result of lowering your levels, sounds you are not meaning to record will also sound fainter.</p><h3 id="9-ADR"><a href="#9-ADR" class="headerlink" title="9. ADR"></a><strong>9. ADR</strong></h3><p>When you need to record a scene in a loud setting where you have very little control over the noise, record additional vocals later and replace the original vocals through a process called automated dialogue replacement.</p><h3 id="10-Record-Ambient-Sound"><a href="#10-Record-Ambient-Sound" class="headerlink" title="10. Record Ambient Sound"></a><strong>10. Record Ambient Sound</strong></h3><p>Remember to record ambient sound or “room tone.” You can use these recordings to fill in the blanks if you run out of audio and also smooth out parts of your audio where you hear pops, clicks, and other unwanted noise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

With such a large community of music listeners on YouTube, many well-known and lesser-known musicians continue to upload their songs regularly. If you’re a music producer, you’ll probably want to do this as well. However, understanding how to upload music to YouTube might be difficult, so this article is created to assist you.</p><p>When you upload a song to YouTube, it becomes available to the entire globe. Unlike other streaming services, anyone can use YouTube for free. This is a one-of-a-kind platform for sharing music. This is an opportunity that every artist should take advantage of, with a potential audience of billions.</p><p>So, how do you go about uploading songs to YouTube? Regular file formats aren’t applicable; therefore, this is the only challenging component. YouTube does not recognize.mp3 or.mp4 files, which makes things a little more difficult for the average producer. It’s simple to get around this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-music-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="how to upload music to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Details On Youtube Music</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</a></p><h2 id="Details-On-Youtube-Music"><a href="#Details-On-Youtube-Music" class="headerlink" title="Details On Youtube Music"></a>Details On Youtube Music</h2><p>YouTube recently added ‘YouTube Music’ to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don’t have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don’t want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube’s music.</p><p>Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.</p><p>Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience’s reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don’t have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn’t have any of these problems.</p><p>YouTube’s other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site’s potential for musical promotion.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?"></a>Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</h2><p>YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production’s audience.</li><li>Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.</li></ul><p><strong>How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?</strong></p><p>If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you’ll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?"></a>Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?</h4><p>YouTube’s music library is relatively small.

Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?"></a>Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?</h4><p>YouTube’s music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It’s rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you’ve made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-instant-aspect-ratio-matching-youtube-on-mac-display/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Instant Aspect Ratio Matching  YouTube on Mac Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ssential-guide-top-10-free-youtube-to-mp3-tools-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Guide  Top 10 Free YouTube-to-MP3 Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/prehensive-guide-to-the-best-makeup-tutorials-on-youtube/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to the Best Makeup Tutorials on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-quick-musical-notes-understanding-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Quick Musical Notes  Understanding YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-earnings-enlightenment-joshi-and-youtube-success-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Earnings Enlightenment  Joshi and YouTube Success Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-ultimate-playbook-for-youtube-brand-development-and-expansion/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Playbook for YouTube Brand Development and Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ymphony-of-streams-efficiently-uploading-melodies/"><u>[New] Symphony of Streams  Efficiently Uploading Melodies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/iny-snippets-deciphered-important-facts-in-2024/"><u>[New] Tiny Snippets Deciphered  Important Facts, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/-enhancement-embedding-youtube-into-google-slides-for-2024/"><u>Video Enhancement  Embedding YouTube Into Google Slides for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/closing-credits-creations-affordable-premium-and-more-for-2024/"><u>Closing Credits Creations  Affordable, Premium & More for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-make-stunning-videos-in-minutes-wevideo-online-editor/"><u>New Make Stunning Videos in Minutes WeVideo Online Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-streamlining-media-with-apple-music-and-video-mixes/"><u>[New] Streamlining Media with Apple Music & Video Mixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-tiktok-captioning-guide-adding-descriptive-texts/"><u>In 2024, TikTok Captioning Guide  Adding Descriptive Texts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unfortunately-contacts-has-stopped-error-on-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Unfortunately, Contacts Has Stopped Error on Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/in-2024-pro-level-video-editors-with-intelligent-frame-adjustment/"><u>In 2024, Pro-Level Video Editors with Intelligent Frame Adjustment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ideal-tools-for-secure-vimeo-downloads/"><u>2024 Approved  Ideal Tools for Secure Vimeo Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-create-talking-cartoon-images-using-top-tools/"><u>Updated Create Talking Cartoon Images Using Top Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-realme-12plus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Realme 12+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/innovative-strategies-for-logging-overwatch-skirmishes/"><u>Innovative Strategies for Logging Overwatch Skirmishes</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

No matter how many followers you may currently have, you are an amazing person just as you are with a unique story. Here are ten <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to share your personal story.</p><ul><li><a href="#one">Channel Trailer</a></li><li><a href="#two">My YouTube Story</a></li><li><a href="#three">Draw My Life</a></li><li><a href="#four">Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#five">Never Have I Ever Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#six">Get Ready With me Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#seven">My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Narrated Autobiopic</a></li><li><a href="#nine">25 Facts About Me</a></li><li><a href="#ten">YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</a></li></ul><h3 id="1-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#1-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="1.  Channel Trailer"></a>1.  Channel Trailer</h3><p>Before posting any videos on your channel, it can be a great idea to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a “Channel Trailer” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> summarizing who you are and what your channel is all about.</p><p>YouTuber Shameless Maya does an excellent job of this. She created a visually appealing and engaging 1-2 minute channel trailer that explains exactly what her channel is all about. Feel free to be as creative as you want to be.</p><h3 id="2-My-YouTube-Story"><a href="#2-My-YouTube-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  My YouTube Story"></a>2.  My YouTube Story</h3><p>On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?</p><h3 id="3-Draw-My-Life"><a href="#3-Draw-My-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Draw My Life"></a>3.  Draw My Life</h3><p>“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.</p><h3 id="4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A"><a href="#4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A"></a>4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</h3><p>Who isn’t on Snapchat, Instagram, or both these days? Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q &amp; A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.</p><h3 id="5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A"><a href="#5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A"></a>5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A</h3><p>Who hasn’t played the “Never Have I Ever” game?! Playing this game as a Q &amp; A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.</p><h3 id="6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A"><a href="#6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A"></a>6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A</h3><p>Get ready with me Q &amp; As are some of my favorite videos to watch because it’s nice to see YouTubers strip-down bare-faced to do their makeup and answer popular questions. It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I’m doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.</p><h3 id="7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story"><a href="#7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story" class="headerlink" title="7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story"></a>7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</h3><p>Behind all their smiles and outrageous on-camera personas, there are a lot of YouTubers who are dealing with depression and anxiety. Beauty and fashion YouTuber Alyssa Forever not only shared her story on how she dealt with her depression but gave tips and ways to be happier. If you are facing depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness, it can give others hope if you share your story.</p><h3 id="8-Narrated-Autobiopic"><a href="#8-Narrated-Autobiopic" class="headerlink" title="8.  Narrated Autobiopic"></a>8.  Narrated Autobiopic</h3><p>Narrated Autobiopic videos are a great way to share your story or advice in a cinematic way. You can be as creative as you want to be. YouTuber Evelyn From the Internets posted a narrated autobiopic called “For People Who Feel Behind In Life” that comically introduces her story.</p><h3 id="9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag"><a href="#9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag" class="headerlink" title="9.  25 Facts About Me Tag"></a>9.  25 Facts About Me Tag</h3><p>This is probably one of the easiest ways to share things about yourself when starting as a YouTuber or even if you’re a veteran. Viewers are always looking to learn more interesting things about you so you are more relatable. I’ve been a fan of Vasseur Beauty for a few years now and was surprised by many of the things she shared about herself.</p><h3 id="10-YouTube-Live-Webinar"><a href="#10-YouTube-Live-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar"></a>10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</h3><p>YouTube live videos are probably the best ways to interact and share your story with viewers. Viewers can ask questions on the spot. YouTuber Roberto Blake shares great live videos on how to improve your videos and things he’s learned through personal experience.</p><h2 id="Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Custom Your Video with Excellent Video Editor"></a>Custom Your Video with Excellent Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-elevate-views-prime-seo-equipment-for-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevate Views  Prime SEO Equipment for Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-decode-the-art-of-youtube-shorts-with-hit-songs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Decode the Art of YouTube Shorts with Hit Songs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-discover-iconic-cinema-essential-youtube-channels/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discover Iconic Cinema  Essential YouTube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-just-initial-acquisition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Just Initial Acquisition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-ultimate-profit-prodigy-in-the-digital-age/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Profit Prodigy in the Digital Age</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-cultivate-creativity-10plus-channel-driven-video-suggestions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cultivate Creativity  10+ Channel-Driven Video Suggestions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-youtube-success-12-proven-methods/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Secrets to YouTube Success  12 Proven Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-profitable-pathways-8-steps-for-youtube-earning/"><u>In 2024, Profitable Pathways  8 Steps for YouTube Earning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-leap-over-a-thousand-followers-on-youtube-quickly-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Leap Over a Thousand Followers on YouTube Quickly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/rk-nodes-sites-that-spotlight-youtube-paid-content/"><u>Network Nodes  Sites That Spotlight YouTube Paid Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-11-pro-max-backup-password-never-set-but-still-asking-heres-the-fix-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, iPhone 11 Pro Max Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking?

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.</p><h2 id="Snapshots-of-Your-Day"><a href="#Snapshots-of-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="Snapshots of Your Day"></a>Snapshots of Your Day</h2><p> Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.</p><p>Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.</p><p>It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.</p><p>Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.</p><h2 id="What-did-you-learn-today"><a href="#What-did-you-learn-today" class="headerlink" title="What did you learn today?"></a>What did you learn today?</h2><p> <em>Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for ‘Yesterday’ were ‘Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs’.</em></p><p> You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:</p><p> Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.</p><p>The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.</p><p>Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.</p><p>The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).</p><p>Sea monkeys can survive in space.</p><h2 id="EVERYTHING"><a href="#EVERYTHING" class="headerlink" title="EVERYTHING"></a>EVERYTHING</h2><p>You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school&#x2F;work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone. It will be exactly what appeals to some people, though.</p><h2 id="Customize-Your-Vlog-Stories-with-Powerful-Video-Editor"><a href="#Customize-Your-Vlog-Stories-with-Powerful-Video-Editor"

Former PayPal employees Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim founded YouTube in 2005 and only a year later their platform was one of the world’s fastest growing websites, surpassing MySpace with more than 100 million video views in the July of the same year. It wasn’t long before YouTube was purchased by Google on November 13. 2006 and since then the world’s most popular video sharing platform has grown continuously.</p><p>In 2017, more than 500 hours of video content are being uploaded to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> each minute, and over 1.5 billion active users utilize it to share their memories, music they love, business ideas or anything else they feel strongly about. The following infographic will present some of the most interesting YouTube facts and statistics that will enable you to understand better one of the most popular websites ever created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/mind-blowing-youtube-stats-facts-2017.jpg"                      alt="mind blowing youtube stats facts 2017"                ></p><p>It’s hard to pick highlights from such an interesting and comprehensive read, but a couple of key stats shine out.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube has just 0,5 billion users less than Facebook</strong></li></ul><p>Mark Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the best-known business geniuses who made his fortune by creating the social network everyone wanted to be a part of. With more than 2 billion active users Facebook is the largest online community on the Internet today. YouTube has 1.5 billion active monthly users which makes it the second largest platform of its kind, well ahead of Instagram, LinkedIn or Twitter.</p><ul><li><strong>People aged 24 to 44 watch the most videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>This information isn’t particularly surprising since younger generations use the Internet more frequently than the older ones. 49% of all YouTube users are aged between 24 and 44, but this statistic will likely change in the future since YouTube’s popularity can only increase. What comes in as a surprise is the fact that men spend 24% more time on YouTube than women. Could it be that men are more interested in music, short videos or promotional business videos than women or perhaps, women are simply more practical and thus tend to spend less time aimlessly going through endless video content.</p><ul><li><strong>9% of the videos are taken down because of the copyright infringements</strong></li></ul><p>At one point in the early 2000’s, it seemed as if the copyright laws will be changed forever by the Internet. Since then countless initiatives have prevented YouTube users to view, upload or share content that they don’t have the permission to use. In 2017, 9% of all videos uploaded on YouTube are taken down by the copyright holders. This means that YouTubers must make sure that all content they upload is unique or that they at least have a permission to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>An average person spends 40 minutes on YouTube each day</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube is probably one of the best pastimes the Internet can offer, and for that reason, a common person spends 40 minutes on YouTube per day. When you add an average life expectancy into the equation the math shows that during their lifetimes, people spend nearly 2 years on YouTube, or 1 year and 10 months to be exact.</p><ul><li><strong>Pop music singers are the most popular celebrities on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>Naturally, music is the most searched term on YouTube, and celebrities like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry or Rihana have millions of subscribers with billions of total video views. Unlike Facebook where the most popular celebrities are Christiano Ronaldo or Vin Diesel, an actor and a football player, YouTube stars are mostly musicians and Pop Culture icons whose music is available to fans across the globe because of this platform. Some of the historically most viewed videos on YouTube are Luis Fonsi’s Despacito, Psy’s Gangnam Style or Tayler Swift’s Shake it Off that all have a staggering amount of views.</p><p>Let us know what you think about these interesting facts about YouTube in the comments below and feel free to share this article with your friends and colleagues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/uplets-of-quality-youtubes-channels-for-2024/"><u>Quintuplets of Quality  YouTube's Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-expert-stock-videos-top-channels-for-analysis/"><u>[Updated] Expert Stock Videos  Top Channels for Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-harnessing-google-trends-for-video-concept-generation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Harnessing Google Trends for Video Concept Generation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-step-by-step-guide-to-adjust-youtube-video-speeds-on-the-fly/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-By-Step Guide to Adjust YouTube Video Speeds on the Fly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-does-quick-subscribe-strategy-boost-audience-growth/"><u>In 2024, Does Quick-Subscribe Strategy Boost Audience Growth?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-decoding-veiled-content-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Decoding Veiled Content on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/reating-a-prime-business-channel-top-picks-and-simple-steps/"><u>[New] Creating a Prime Business Channel  Top Picks & Simple Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-bite-sized-video-lessons-clearly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Bite-Sized Video Lessons, Clearly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-cementing-climactic-conclusions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Cementing Climactic Conclusions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-podcast-titling-evolution-10-ai-generators-to-watch/"><u>In 2024, Podcast Titling Evolution  10 AI Generators to Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-into-the-virtual-epoch-analyzing-present-state-and-ahead/"><u>In 2024, Into the Virtual Epoch  Analyzing Present State and Ahead</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-androids-video-reversion-secrets-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] Android's Video Reversion Secrets Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-my-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-location-is-wrong-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix My Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Location Is Wrong | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-teacher-friendly-video-capture-options-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Teacher-Friendly Video Capture Options Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/1716040962009-updated-in-2024-the-7-best-fps-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The 7 Best FPS Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-real-time-engagement-strategies-for-online-streamers/"><u>2024 Approved  Real-Time Engagement Strategies for Online Streamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-vsco-image-enhancement/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step VSCO Image Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-apple-iphone-6-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Apple iPhone 6 Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-webcam-mastery-how-to-transform-your-video-recording/"><u>2024 Approved  WebCam Mastery  How to Transform Your Video Recording</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1. Razer Man O’War 7.1</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#audiotech">2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#logitec">3.

HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset</a></strong></p><h2 id="1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1"><a href="#1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1" class="headerlink" title="**1. Razer Man O’ War 7.1"></a>**1. Razer Man O’ War 7.1</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-man-headset1.jpg"                      alt="Razer Man O&#39;War 7.1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $222.48</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox</p><p>This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset" class="headerlink" title="**2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset"></a>**2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-technica-headset2.jpg"                      alt="Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $299</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)</p><p>For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430" class="headerlink" title="**3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430"></a>**3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitec-gaming-headset3.jpg"                      alt="Logitec G430 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $79.99</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="**4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset"></a>**4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kraken-headset4.jpg"                      alt="Razer Kraken Chroma Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p><p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p><p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p><h2 id="5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="**5.

It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p><p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> b and elegant aluminum frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Advanced audio control box</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Virtual 7.1 surround audio</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Interchangeable ear pads</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Premium look and feel at an affordable price</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Inconveniently positioned mute switch</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Relatively short cord limiting movement</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9</h2><p>No doubt gamers would need a lot of effects and overlays to edit a live stream video to show the best effects on the game screen.
