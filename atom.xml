According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube.

(what is a niche, and how to find)"></a>Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><h3 id="Patreon"><a href="#Patreon" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!</p><h2 id="Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube"></a>Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</h2><p>Vloggers on YouTube are earning some big money.

It all comes down to a person’s personality, interests, and preferences.</p><h3 id="3-What-equipment-do-I-need-to-start-vlogging"><a href="#3-What-equipment-do-I-need-to-start-vlogging" class="headerlink" title="3.

A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality-1"><a href="#Content-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads-1"><a href="#YouTube-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing-1"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers.

By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products-1"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products-1" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services.

You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p><p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p><h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p><p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p><p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p><p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p><p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p><p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p><h4 id="1-Give-Value"><a href="#1-Give-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p><p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p><p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p><p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p><p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p><p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p><p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p><h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p><p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p><p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p><p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p><h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p><p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p><p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p><p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p><h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p><h4 id="1-Be-Original"><a href="#1-Be-Original" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p><p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p><p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p><p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p><h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p><p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p><p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p><p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p><h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p><p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p><p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p><p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p><p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p><p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p><p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p><h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p><h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p><p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p><h4 id="2-Reviews"><a href="#2-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p><h4 id="3-Walkthrough"><a href="#3-Walkthrough" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p><h4 id="4-Reactions"><a href="#4-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p><h4 id="5-Skills"><a href="#5-Skills" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p><h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p><p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p><p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p><p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p><p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p><p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p><p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p><p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p><p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p><p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p><p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p><p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p><p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p><p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have all the capabilities.</p><h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p><p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p><h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p><p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p><p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p><h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p><p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p><h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p><p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p><p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"                      alt="Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"                ></p><p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p><p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"                      alt="Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"                ></p><p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p><p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p><p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p><p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p><p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p><p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p><h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p><p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p><ol><li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li><li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li></ol><p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-awesome-thumbnail-youtube-gaming-1.jpg"                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"                ></p><ol><li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li></ol><p>Check out the colorful thumbnails from VanossGaming, where the owl is the mascot of their channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-awesome-thumbnail-youtube-gaming-2.jpg"                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"                ></p><ol><li>Use readable text or emojis</li></ol><p>If you don’t have Photoshop or don’t have strong design skills, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare Pixstudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a drag-and-drop design tool that makes creating thumbnails easy.</p><h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p><p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p><p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p><p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p><p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p><p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p><p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p><h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2.

These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of <strong>can YouTube Shorts be monetized</strong> and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Editor</strong> A cross-platform helps creators edit the vertical videos quickly and easily!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP"                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done. That’s all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.</p><p>Check this video tutorial to see how YouTube creators edit their YouTubes

When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.</p><ol><li><a href="#pixlr">PIXLR EDITOR</a></li><li><a href="#getpaint">GETPAINT</a></li><li><a href="#canva">CANVA</a></li><li><a href="#designevo">DESIGNEVO</a></li><li><a href="#logomakr">LOGOMAKR</a></li><li><a href="#fotor">FOTOR</a></li><li><a href="#snappa">SNAPPA</a></li><li><a href="#logaster">LOGASTER</a></li><li><a href="#cooltext">COOLTEXT</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-PIXLR-EDITOR"><a href="#1-PIXLR-EDITOR" class="headerlink" title="1. PIXLR EDITOR"></a>1. PIXLR EDITOR</h2><p>PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.</p><h2 id="2-GETPAINT"><a href="#2-GETPAINT" class="headerlink" title="2. GETPAINT"></a>2. GETPAINT</h2><p>GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.</p><h2 id="3-CANVA"><a href="#3-CANVA" class="headerlink" title="3. CANVA"></a>3. CANVA</h2><p>Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.</p><h2 id="4-DESIGNEVO"><a href="#4-DESIGNEVO" class="headerlink" title="4. DESIGNEVO"></a>4. DESIGNEVO</h2><p>Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.</p><h2 id="5-LOGOMAKR"><a href="#5-LOGOMAKR" class="headerlink" title="5. LOGOMAKR"></a>5. LOGOMAKR</h2><p>Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.</p><h2 id="6-FOTOR"><a href="#6-FOTOR" class="headerlink" title="6. FOTOR"></a>6. FOTOR</h2><p>Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.</p><h2 id="7-SNAPPA"><a href="#7-SNAPPA" class="headerlink" title="7. SNAPPA"></a>7. SNAPPA</h2><p>Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.</p><h2 id="8-LOGASTER"><a href="#8-LOGASTER" class="headerlink" title="8. LOGASTER"></a>8. LOGASTER</h2><p>For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.</p><h2 id="9-COOLTEXT"><a href="#9-COOLTEXT" class="headerlink" title="9. COOLTEXT"></a>9. COOLTEXT</h2><p>Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.</p><p>If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html" >YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Have you ever used a YouTube logo maker?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-skyrocket-engagement-optimizing-videos-for-peak-views/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Skyrocket Engagement  Optimizing Videos for Peak Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-premier-content-creators-colloquy/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Premier Content Creators Colloquy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/10-tiktok-trends-in-video-responses-for-2024/"><u>10 TikTok Trends in Video Responses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/the-best-ispoofer-alternative-to-try-on-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Samsung Galaxy M54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-perfect-your-youtube-intro-step-by-step-method-a-plus-b/"><u>[New] Perfect Your YouTube Intro  Step by Step (Method A + B)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/tweeting-videos-directly-from-your-phone-no-rt-for-2024/"><u>Tweeting Videos Directly From Your Phone (No RT) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-direct-from-spotify-to-youtube-best-apps-for-streaming-conversions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Direct From Spotify to YouTube  Best Apps for Streaming Conversions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-free-games-galore-top-10-download-sites-for-pc-android-and-tablet/"><u>Updated In 2024, Free Games Galore Top 10 Download Sites for PC, Android, and Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-are-you-looking-for-a-good-stop-motion-studio-online-try-out-stop-motion-studio-as-it-has-all-the-features-you-need-to-create-beautiful-an/"><u>New 2024 Approved Are You Looking for a Good Stop Motion Studio Online?

In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.</p><p>Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.</p><ul><li><a href="#dumbo"><strong>A map of Dumbo</strong></a></li><li><a href="#postcards"><strong>Post Cards</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bottle"><strong>S’well bottle</strong></a></li><li><a href="#slippers"><strong>Branded slippers</strong></a></li><li><a href="#pins"><strong>Pins, pins, pins</strong></a></li><li><a href="#jacket"><strong>Denim jacket</strong></a></li></ul><p><em>Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures.</em></p><p>The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-2017.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Summit Group Photo"                ></p><p><em>Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY"><em>he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh</em></a> <em>.</em></p><p>Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.</p><p><em>Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room.</em></p><p>There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:</p><h2 id="1-A-map-of-Dumbo"><a href="#1-A-map-of-Dumbo" class="headerlink" title="1. A map of Dumbo"></a>1. A map of Dumbo</h2><p>The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.</p><p><em>Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo.</em></p><p>Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.</p><h2 id="2-Post-Cards"><a href="#2-Post-Cards" class="headerlink" title="2. Post Cards"></a>2. Post Cards</h2><p>One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.</p><h2 id="3-S’well-bottle"><a href="#3-S’well-bottle" class="headerlink" title="3. S’well bottle"></a>3. S’well bottle</h2><p>S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention&#x2F;conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.</p><h2 id="4-Branded-slippers"><a href="#4-Branded-slippers" class="headerlink" title="4. Branded slippers"></a>4. Branded slippers</h2><p>To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg"                      alt="Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                ></p><p><em>thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers.</em></p><h2 id="5-Pins-pins-pins"><a href="#5-Pins-pins-pins" class="headerlink" title="5. Pins, pins, pins"></a>5. Pins, pins, pins</h2><p>There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.</p><h2 id="6-Denim-jacket"><a href="#6-Denim-jacket" class="headerlink" title="6. Denim jacket"></a>6. Denim jacket</h2><p>A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.</p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg"                      alt="Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                > _</p><p><em>Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit.</em></p><p>Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!</p><p>Want to join the YouTube Creator Summit in the future?

In order to do so, we have to prepare it for success. If you are hoping to optimize a video after it has already been published to YouTube, then you aren’t going to get the best result, because much of optimization is done before the video is even shot.a</p><p>In this article, we will give you <a class="link"   href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1HmRcFwFVA-DtbFBStNZ3jOsYDNvDhj/view?usp=sharing" >a checklist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which you should have with you at the very beginning of creating a YouTube video: the ideation stage.

Keep Your Audience’s Attention:"></a><strong>1. Keep Your Audience’s Attention:</strong></h2><p>Even though your view count is going up, it doesn’t mean your audience is watching your video. And if they are not, then YouTube is going to consider your video less valuable and therefore, lowering its rank.</p><p>Audience Retention is an important metric to keep an eye on after every video you’ve published.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/measurign-audience-retention.png.png"                      alt="low-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Before you start your next project, take a look back at the Audience Retention of your previous videos.  </p><ol><li>Enter YouTube Studio in your channel</li><li>Access to Analytics</li><li>Select the video you want to review</li><li>Click into engagement</li><li>See where a dip in watch time</li></ol><h3 id="What-is-Good-Audience-Retention"><a href="#What-is-Good-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="What is Good Audience Retention?"></a><strong>What is Good Audience Retention?</strong></h3><p>If you want to see how your Audience Retention is performing, the Average Percentage Viewed will give you a broad perspective. The higher the percentage, the more people are watching your entire video.</p><p>If you get above <strong>60%</strong> Average Percentage Viewed, you should feel very proud. In our modern world with our short attention span, that is considered good retention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-one.png"                      alt="audience-retention-one"                ></p><p>In the example above, we see that on average, a viewer will only see 44% of the video. For the video below, we see that it only has 30% of the video viewed. Overall, the first video is performing better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-two.jpg"                      alt="audience-retention-two"                ></p><p>There is also a dip that happens at the beginning in the second example, which indicates that viewers are skipping forward and about 20% then deciding it’s not worth continuing. It’s good data to help you improve your introduction and the hook.</p><p>If there is important information that you are presenting at a given point and in the Audience Retention you see that only a small percentage of your viewers actually see it, then for the next video, you might want to position the details in a different point in the video.</p><h3 id="How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Improve Audience Retention</strong></h3><p>Here are a few ways you can retain your audience’s attention if you noticed a drop in viewership:</p><p><strong>- Film a hook</strong> (introduce your video to let the audience know what to expect)</p><p><strong>- Add b-roll</strong> (having supplemental footage to cut to makes your video more interesting to watch)</p><p><strong>- Have a co-host</strong> (Having someone on screen gives the video more dynamic interactions)</p><p><strong>- Edit out the unimportant stuff</strong></p><p><strong>- Write a conclusion</strong> (having a conclusion prepared will allow you to transition from the content of the video to the call to action without the audience even knowing) See this example by PolyMatter below and notice how seamless their ending is.</p><p>If you have a video that is doing a good job retaining the audience, then replicate it. If there isn’t, keep experimenting with new structures. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Improving audience retention <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not simply important for your ranking, but it will affirm that you are building quality videos.</p><p>Knowing how to structure your video will allow you to be strategic as you build out your content.</p><h2 id="2-Do-Keyword-Research"><a href="#2-Do-Keyword-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. Do Keyword Research:"></a><strong>2. Do Keyword Research:</strong></h2><p>Many viewers find YouTube videos via search, and if you aren’t using the appropriate keywords, then YouTube won’t be able to identify your content and display it for your viewers.</p><h3 id="Where-Do-Keywords-Appear-on-YouTube"><a href="#Where-Do-Keywords-Appear-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Where Do Keywords Appear on YouTube?"></a><strong>Where Do Keywords Appear on YouTube?</strong></h3><p><strong>- Title:</strong> Have keywords at the beginning of the title and limit them up to approximately 60 characters so it appears in full in search.</p><p><strong>- Tags</strong>: Include 10-15 tags from general keywords to more specific.</p><p><strong>- Descriptions:</strong> Put important information and keywords at the beginning of the description so both searcher and the search engine understands what the video is about.</p><h3 id="Why-Keywords-Matter"><a href="#Why-Keywords-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Why Keywords Matter"></a><strong>Why Keywords Matter</strong></h3><p>keyword arrangement is an integral part of <strong>YouTube optimization</strong> because the robots behind YouTube don’t associate the value of the actual video content with what the viewer is actually seeking. You should pay attention to the relevance of keywords.</p><p>Even when you add closed captions, it doesn’t mean the best keywords are present to the Youtube search engine when we speak.</p><p>That is why it is important to know your audience and what words and phrases they are going to use to search for your video.</p><p>Here is how you can see what keywords were used to find your video:</p><ol><li>Enter YouTube Studio in your channel</li><li>Access Analytics</li><li>Select Reach</li><li>Click into Traffic Source</li><li>Click Traffic Source: YouTube Search</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/traffic-source-youtube-search.png.png"                      alt="traffic-source"                ></p><p>If you want to find some new keywords for your upcoming video, you will need to do some research.</p><p><strong>1. Enter Keywords You Want to Rank for In YouTube Search:</strong> This allows you to see what the most popular phrases are in the YouTube search engine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/search-for-keywords.png"                      alt="search-for-keywords"                ></p><p><strong>2. Study the Competitors:</strong> See which videos are ranking high for your search term. Use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see the keywords that the top videos are performing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/vidlq-tool.jpg"                      alt="vidlq-tool"                ></p><p><strong>3. Search for Related Keywords and Evaluate Relevancy:</strong> A tool called <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help you find related keywords and allow you to identify the search volume, cost per click (aka CPC is used for determining the budget for paid search), and the competitiveness of the word or phrase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="ubersuggest"                ></p><p><strong>Search volume:</strong> The number of searches with that particular keyword. The higher the number the more popular it is. You should aim to use keywords with a high search volume.</p><p><strong>Keyword competition score:</strong> This score is usually indicated by a number and it represents how difficult it is for a keyword to rank due to other pages already ranking for that word or phrase. You want to find a keyword with a low competition score.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The best combination is high search volume and low competition score. But if you can’t get that perfect mix, go for the low competitive score, as it will give you a better chance to rank, even if it isn’t searched as often.</p><p><strong>4. Come Up With Content Related to Those Keywords:</strong> To come up with topic ideas around a keyword, you can use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://answerthepublic.com/" >Answer the Public <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which gives you all the most popular questions searched online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/answer-the-public.jpg"                      alt="answer-the-public"                ></p><h2 id="3-Engage-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Engage-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage Your Audience:"></a><strong>3. Engage Your Audience:</strong></h2><p>It’s been highly discussed on forums all over the Internet, and there appears to be a strong correlation between <a class="link"   href="https://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors" >YouTube video ranking and the number of likes, dislikes, and comments <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the video received.</p><p>While YouTube itself might not be using the number of likes and comments to determine where your video rank, having high engagement allows your video to be discovered through other means.</p><p>Here is an example of how it would work:</p><p>- A YouTuber with 100,000 subscribers views your video and likes it</p><p>- Then your video might be visible to a fraction of those 100,000 subscribers.</p><p>- Boom! Domino effect!</p><p>- More people will see your video and like it, increasing your network of viewers and your watch time, which is one of the main factors that YouTube takes into consideration.</p><p> <strong>Get engagements with a call to action</strong>:</p><p>- Don’t be afraid to ask for an engagement at the beginning of the video to avoid fall off on retention.</p><p>- Encourage them to leave a comment or start a discussion by asking a question at the end of your video.</p><p>- Monitor comments and responds to them so you can build a relationship with your audience over time.</p><p>It’s all about creating a community and that is what YouTube encourages.</p><h2 id="4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length"><a href="#4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length" class="headerlink" title="4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:"></a><strong>4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:</strong></h2><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on watch time, and in addition to that, it puts more weight on session watch time.</p><p>Session watch time is counted when people watch your video and then continue to watch others, it doesn’t have to be your own. The more time people spend watching YouTube videos, as a result of your content, the more likely YouTube will increase your ranking.</p><p>Since YouTube puts importance on time spent watching videos, the length of your video will play a key role.</p><p>If you have 5 videos and all of them are a minute long, a 100% watch through will only get you 5 minutes total.</p><p>However, if you have 1 video that is 20 minutes, and an average viewer only watches half of it, then you have an average watch time of over 10 minutes. <strong>That’s more than double what your five short videos can do.</strong> This longer video is worth more. However, if that 20-minute video is really boring and people drop off in the first minute, then it’s not any better than 1 of the 5 short videos.</p><p>If your format allows, go for a longer video instead of a shorter one. But the most important thing is that you can keep people watching your videos: so use end screen and playlist links to keep them engaged.</p><p><strong>End screen:</strong> Pick related videos for your audience, so they know exactly what they should watch next. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a background template for your end screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/related-videos-for-your-audience.jpg"                      alt="related-videos-for-your-audience"                ></p><p><strong>Playlist</strong>: If you have multiple videos that fit a specific topic, add them to a playlist so the viewer can enjoy them all in one viewing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist.jpg"                      alt="add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist"                ></p><h4 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4><ol><li>Use <strong>Audience Retention</strong> to better understand how to structure your video for the best results.</li><li>Perform <strong>Keyword Research</strong> to find the keywords that your competitors are using and your audience is searching for.</li><li><strong>Increasing Subscribers</strong> gets your video in front of more people the moment it is published.</li><li><strong>Encourage Comments</strong> and respond to establish a relationship with your viewers.</li><li>Ensure that <strong>Viewers Continue Watching</strong> videos on YouTube after they finish watching yours.</li></ol><h2 id="Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking"></a><strong>Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking</strong></h2><p>Except for the above-mentioned factors, there are also other issues that affect the ranking of your YouTube video. YouTube has stated that the number of subscribers doesn’t play a key role in your video ranking.</p><p>For example, if a YouTuber has a million subscribers and then overnight they lose 100 thousand, a video they had ranking number 1 will still be ranked number 1.</p><p>However, the number of subscribers has a lot of indirect effects on your channel.</p><p>- Subscribers know the moment your video is published</p><p>- Subscribers will watch your video in the first week (YouTube will rank your video higher if they see a lift in the first week of publishing)</p><p>- YouTube put a higher value on subscribers than views and social shares, because it’s harder to fake subscribers</p><p>Growing subscribers take time and effort, and even though it shouldn’t be your main focus, there are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tactics you can do to gain more subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t miss a chance to optimize your YouTube video, download, and print out this checklist for your next video project.

The best way to grow your channel is to focus on putting out quality content consistently. We do not recommend the following methods, but they do exist. Here are a couple of alternatives to purchasing views which are along those same lines (if you want to know how to grow organically without resorting to tactics like these, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) When YouTube first started, getting views and subscribers was a lot easier. That’s not to say that creator didn’t have to work hard on their channels, just that they had a lot less competition.</p><p>YouTube has become so popular now that it is not uncommon for creators to look for alternative ways to stand out. Some might choose to buy views to kick start the organic growth of their channels (which is not a good idea), while others are looking for free ways of getting those views.</p><p>Two of these alternative methods are:</p><p><a href="#exchange"><strong>Part 1: Get More Views with View Exchange Platforms</strong></a></p><p><a href="#bots"><strong>Part 2: Get More YouTube Views with Bots</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-free-youtube-subs-banner.jpg"                      alt="Get free YouTube Subs"                ></a></p><h2 id="1-View-Exchange-Platforms"><a href="#1-View-Exchange-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="#1: View Exchange Platforms"></a>#1: View Exchange Platforms</h2><p>There are a variety of websites to choose from, but the main purpose is the same: you watch other people’s videos in order for them to watch your videos.</p><p>Here are the most popular view exchange platforms:</p><h4 id="1-View2be"><a href="#1-View2be" class="headerlink" title="1.

After you sign up, you will need to start watching videos from other YouTube publishers who are also members at View2be in order to earn coins. One of the differences between View2be and other view exchange platforms is that here, you can also complete some other tasks such as liking videos in order to earn more coins.</p><p>You can then spend the coins on views and likes for your own videos.</p><h4 id="2-GrowViews"><a href="#2-GrowViews" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is how the platform lists your YouTube videos.</p><p>After signing in, you just need to click on the Play button. The site’s player will work on the background, playing videos from other YouTube creators.</p><p>For each video that you watch, you will get 1 credit that you can then exchange for views on your own videos.</p><h4 id="3-YTMonster"><a href="#3-YTMonster" class="headerlink" title="3.

This will give you access to a dashboard where you can choose how to use the credits that you earn as well as keep track of what you have already spent credits on.</p><p>With YTMonster, you will be able to contact other video publishers like you and exchange not only views but comments, likes, and even subscriptions as well.

This platform isn’t only for YouTube views, it is for the exchange of social actions across multiple websites. One of the main advantages of using the KingdomLikes is that you can also use this same platform to get likes or views on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as well as on YouTube.</p><p>Just like with the other platforms, you will need to watch other people’s videos in order to earn views for yourself.</p><h4 id="5-AddVisits"><a href="#5-AddVisits" class="headerlink" title="5. AddVisits"></a>5. AddVisits</h4><p>After creating your free account on AddVisits you’ll get to a dashboard where you’ll need to enter the URL of the YouTube video you want free views for.</p><p>AddVisits reviews each video submitted in this way to ensure that it complies with YouTube’s Terms of Service. Once your video is approved, you define how many points you are willing to give to people who watch your videos or like them. In exchange, you watch other people’s videos and get points as compensation. You can then exchange those points for more views or likes.</p><h2 id="2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots"><a href="#2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots" class="headerlink" title="#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots"></a>#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots</h2><p>When most people think about getting free views on YouTube, they immediately think about bots.</p><p>Bots can be dangerous for your channel. The wrong bot can really hurt your search rankings and if you get caught using bots you can lose your account.</p><p>If you are going to try a bot, make sure you choose one that offers high retention views (most can’t, but may say they can). High retention views mean YouTube interprets the data as someone watching your video for a period of time, vs just clicking on it and then leaving the page. A bot that can’t offer high retention views just ends up making it look like a lot of people clicked on your video, but none of them liked it enough to watch. That will cause YouTube to rank your video very low in its search results.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-better-youtube-videos--278.html" >Making great content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and polishing up your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >YouTube SEO skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you grow your channel over time, and this is probably the best way to go.

It’s highly effective and can be used for different topics and subjects. If you don’t know what a green screen is and how it works, check out the video tutorial below to get an overall idea first:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>In fact, nowadays, green screen is actually well within the capabilities and budget of people like you and I. Just shoot your video anywhere, and then replace the background with any stock photo, branded graphic or fantastic video clips. Want to try it out? You’d better get your own green screen ideas first.

Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.</p><p>Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?</h2><p>An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.</p><p>Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.</p><p>You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.</p><p>Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape"                ></p><p>The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.</p><p>Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract"                ></p><p>Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.</p><p>You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Adding-Video-to-Text-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Adding-Video-to-Text-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora"></a>Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora</h2><p>Besides presentation software, you can also use video editing software products to add a video to text. Filmora lets you add a video to text in just a few simple steps. You can first make a text video with animation first, and then use the picture in picture feature to add the video to text. Here are the detailed information about how to add a video to text in Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>You should start by creating a new project in Filmora and importing the video you want to add to the text into the project. Click on the Titles tab, and choose the title that matches the visual style of your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-title-effects.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9"                ></p><p>Set the preferred duration of the title by dragging one of its ends to the left or right after you place it on the timeline, and then double-click on it to customize it. Click on the Advanced button once the Text tab opens and insert the text into the Input Text box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-text-video-advanced-text-edit.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9 Advanced Editing"                ></p><p>Proceed to select a font and adjust the text size before deciding if you want to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animate the text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When done, you should export the title as a video file, and then import it back into your project.</p><p>Now it’s time to add the text video and the background video to the project media library, and then place the two videos one above the other. Since we’re adding video to text, the text video should be placed above the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9 Compositing"                ></p><p>Click on the video that contains text to gain access to the Video tab of the Editor panel and then expand the Compositing menu.
