To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

Hitting on the road at the right time can get you as many viewers as possible. YouTube makes getting the facts right quite easy. Just use YouTube studio to know when your viewers are online.</p><p>First, go to YouTube Studio<br>Check in the “YouTube Studio” &gt; “Analytics” &gt; “Audience” option. Remember that your channel should have enough views for this option to give you relevant data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-2.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - check performance"                ></p><p>Find the hours with the darkest purple bars<br>You’ll realize that there are dark bars and light ones. The latter represent when few viewers are on your channel. Avoid posting during such times and focus when you have many viewers on site. Also, try to post a few hours before the peak time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-3.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - find the darkest bar"                ></p><p>Focus on the days with the darkest bars<br>Apart from specific times of the day, you can focus on days of the week when your viewers are on your channel. You will mostly realize that the best days of the week to post to your channel are on weekends. It is quite typical as it’s the days when viewers are more relaxed and can find new things online. However, you can monitor your statistics and learn the number of days per week you need to emphasize more on posting your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-4.png"                      alt="choose the best days to post on youtube"                ></p><p>Post videos a day before the peak day<br>You can also dwell on the narrative; the early bird catches the worm. You can make an early catch since you know the day when your viewers will throng’ your channel, but you don’t know the time. Post videos a day before your channel goes busy. By this, you won’t leave any viewers outside your new postings.</p><p>A few hours before prime time<br>Another trick is to get your videos posted in good time. Once you have known the best hour of the day when viewers are likely to be active, make your video available a few hours before then. They’ll then get it rolling once they land into the channel for the newest updates. If not, you may miss out on views you would have gotten by making your video go public earlier.</p><p>Upload your videos in private a few hours before publishing<br>Yes, mistakes do happen, and you don’t want to be caught up in the mix of errors. You can increase perfection by uploading your videos for some hours before publishing them. It will give you a good time to check it out privately and iron out any concerns. You don’t want your video going viral with tons of mishaps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement"></a>Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement</h2><p>Besides knowing the best days to post on YouTube, you have to give your audience quality for their time.

You can use YouTube algorithm Studio to calculate and give you the exact hours and days when your viewers are at bay. But again, this will only be effective if you have already gathered a substantial number of viewers. It will, therefore, not work for you if you are starting on YouTube. Usually, there isn’t enough data yet for the system to know the best time to publish, and neither know how your content performs in general.</p><p>● But all in all, you can use general practices to know when to post your content.

Hitting on the road at the right time can get you as many viewers as possible. YouTube makes getting the facts right quite easy. Just use YouTube studio to know when your viewers are online.</p><p>First, go to YouTube Studio<br>Check in the “YouTube Studio” &gt; “Analytics” &gt; “Audience” option. Remember that your channel should have enough views for this option to give you relevant data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-2.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - check performance"                ></p><p>Find the hours with the darkest purple bars<br>You’ll realize that there are dark bars and light ones. The latter represent when few viewers are on your channel. Avoid posting during such times and focus when you have many viewers on site. Also, try to post a few hours before the peak time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-3.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - find the darkest bar"                ></p><p>Focus on the days with the darkest bars<br>Apart from specific times of the day, you can focus on days of the week when your viewers are on your channel. You will mostly realize that the best days of the week to post to your channel are on weekends. It is quite typical as it’s the days when viewers are more relaxed and can find new things online. However, you can monitor your statistics and learn the number of days per week you need to emphasize more on posting your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-4.png"                      alt="choose the best days to post on youtube"                ></p><p>Post videos a day before the peak day<br>You can also dwell on the narrative; the early bird catches the worm. You can make an early catch since you know the day when your viewers will throng’ your channel, but you don’t know the time. Post videos a day before your channel goes busy. By this, you won’t leave any viewers outside your new postings.</p><p>A few hours before prime time<br>Another trick is to get your videos posted in good time. Once you have known the best hour of the day when viewers are likely to be active, make your video available a few hours before then. They’ll then get it rolling once they land into the channel for the newest updates. If not, you may miss out on views you would have gotten by making your video go public earlier.</p><p>Upload your videos in private a few hours before publishing<br>Yes, mistakes do happen, and you don’t want to be caught up in the mix of errors. You can increase perfection by uploading your videos for some hours before publishing them. It will give you a good time to check it out privately and iron out any concerns. You don’t want your video going viral with tons of mishaps.</p><h2 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement-3"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement"></a>Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement</h2><p>Besides knowing the best days to post on YouTube, you have to give your audience quality for their time.

You can use YouTube algorithm Studio to calculate and give you the exact hours and days when your viewers are at bay. But again, this will only be effective if you have already gathered a substantial number of viewers. It will, therefore, not work for you if you are starting on YouTube. Usually, there isn’t enough data yet for the system to know the best time to publish, and neither know how your content performs in general.</p><p>● But all in all, you can use general practices to know when to post your content. Most likely, combine your efforts and don’t dwell on specific hours or days. Use both combined to reach as many audiences as possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/trategic-media-mapping-charting-your-course-against-competitors-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Strategic Media Mapping Charting Your Course Against Competitors' Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/treamlining-discovery-the-key-to-effective-video-titling/"><u>[New] Streamlining Discovery The Key to Effective Video Titling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-from-capturing-moments-to-sharing-them-editing-with-adobe-premiere/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From Capturing Moments to Sharing Them Editing with Adobe Premiere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-mastering-asmr-filming-techniques-essential-tips-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering ASMR Filming Techniques Essential Tips Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/guide-to-fixing-common-icloud-sync-challenges-and-keeping-your-data-secure/"><u>Guide to Fixing Common iCloud Sync Challenges and Keeping Your Data Secure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-oneplus-open-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data After Switching From OnePlus Open to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/navigating-the-editorial-maze-answers-for-filmora-users-for-2024/"><u>Navigating the Editorial Maze Answers for Filmora Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/unleashing-video-magic-on-tiktok-with-pre-made-designs/"><u>Unleashing Video Magic on TikTok with Pre-Made Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/vimeo-basic-vimeo-plus-or-vimeo-pro-which-is-right-for-you/"><u>Vimeo Basic, Vimeo Plus or Vimeo Pro Which Is Right for You?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.</p><p>When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >running a successful YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth. So, as a YouTube creator, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html" >growing your subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should definitely be a top priority.</p><p>There are many tips out there on how to go about <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-top-10-smartest-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-311.html" >increasing your YouTube subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.</p><ol><li><a href="#links"><strong>Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#sort">Sort Your Videos Into Playlists</a></strong></li><li><a href="#trailer"><strong>Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video</strong></a></li><li><a href="#rivals"><strong>Add Your Rivals To Your Tags</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS"><a href="#1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS" class="headerlink" title="1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly. And in addition, the more you are seen to create content that’s similar to the best videos, the more viewers are likely to subscribe to your channel.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2><p>The tips on this list are simple, straightforward, and sure to deliver results.

But with no experience or training, it’s hard to know how to start a vlog and make money.</p><p>Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!</p><p>This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel. You’ll learn everything you need to know, from finding your niche and the best ways to promote your vlog. Once your vlog starts getting views, you’ll see how to turn your viewers into subscribers, make money, and become a YouTube sensation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg"                      alt="start vlog and make money"                ></p><p><strong>Background of vlogs on YouTube</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg"                      alt="background of vlogs on youtube"                ></p><p>What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube.

(what is a niche, and how to find)"></a>Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2135474/26400" target="_top" id="2135474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2135474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135474/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos.

Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving-1"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving-1" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today.

Is daily vlogging worth it?"></a>1. Is daily vlogging worth it?</h3><p>Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.</p><p>However, many vloggers have found that it isn’t easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.</p><h3 id="2-What-is-the-best-topic-for-vlogging-1"><a href="#2-What-is-the-best-topic-for-vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the best topic for vlogging?"></a>2. What is the best topic for vlogging?</h3><p>There isn’t a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger’s most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person’s personality, interests, and preferences.</p><h3 id="3-What-equipment-do-I-need-to-start-vlogging-1"><a href="#3-What-equipment-do-I-need-to-start-vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.</p><p>In addition to the gear needed to get started, there is one more item you’ll need to consider to produce quality vlogs. A video editing software that helps you convert your raw footage into eye-catching content, like Wondershare Filmora.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>So, in summary, if you want to become a vlogger, you will need to figure out how to find your target audience, connect with them, and keep them interested in you. And you can do all of this through social media, advertising, and email marketing. It might be tough at first, but once you get started, you’ll be able to start generating revenue pretty quickly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ecuring-viewer-return-with-these-effective-strategies-for-higher-retention-rates/"><u>[New] Securing Viewer Return with These Effective Strategies for Higher Retention Rates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-charting-the-course-from-scale-to-submillions-in-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Charting the Course From Scale to Submillions in Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-unveiling-the-swift-growing-youtube-sources-for-inspiration/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unveiling the Swift-Growing YouTube Sources for Inspiration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-expert-advice-on-achieving-high-quality-gopro-videos/"><u>[Updated] Expert Advice on Achieving High-Quality GoPro Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/9-quick-fixes-to-unfortunately-touchwiz-has-stopped-of-realme-narzo-n53-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>9 Quick Fixes to Unfortunately TouchWiz has stopped Of Realme Narzo N53 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/complete-picture-a-close-look-at-the-google-podcasts-app-for-2024/"><u>Complete Picture A Close Look at the Google Podcasts App for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/innovative-chargeless-illumination-evaluating-the-robustness-of-romers-rechargeable-lantern/"><u>Innovative Chargeless Illumination: Evaluating the Robustness of Romer's Rechargeable Lantern</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Like 35mm film cameras of the past, DSLR cameras are built with an angled mirror inside its camera body. This mirror allows you to look into your camera’s optical viewfinder and see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>The mirror inside a DSLR camera flips up out of the way when you open the shutter to allow light to reach the camera’s image sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >7 Best DSLR Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera"><a href="#What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What is a Mirrorless Camera?"></a>What is a Mirrorless Camera?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-camera.jpg"                      alt="Mirrorless Camera"                ></p><p>Mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras without a mirror inside the camera body. With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Mirrorless Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison</h2><h4 id="Size-and-Weight"><a href="#Size-and-Weight" class="headerlink" title="Size and Weight"></a>Size and Weight</h4><p>DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images"><a href="#Previewing-Images" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.</p><p>Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.</p><h4 id="Lenses-and-Accessories"><a href="#Lenses-and-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Lenses and Accessories"></a>Lenses and Accessories</h4><p>Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.</p><h4 id="Video-Resolution"><a href="#Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Video Resolution"></a>Video Resolution</h4><p>4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p>Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.</p><p>In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.</p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p>When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.</p><p>In the end, if you need to edit videos futhermore, try Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This helps them to develop a personal brand and add context to what their audience is about to see.</p><p>- Outro - It is the customized ending of the video where most content creators choose to add a call to action (CTA) encouraging them to engage with the channel or the video in some manner. For example, they may add an outro that asks the users to subscribe to the YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/intro-video-image-youtube.jpg"                      alt="intro-video-image-youtube"                ></p><ul><li><h4 id="Rich-Stickers-Titles"><a href="#Rich-Stickers-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Rich Stickers &amp; Titles"></a>Rich Stickers &amp; Titles</h4></li></ul><p>These are customized stickers, captions, and titles that enable YouTubers to add contextual information at any point in the video to add more value to their content during the process of cutting MP4 videos.

You’ve also probably noticed that when you looking for royalty-free music or stock footage a lot of it is licensed through creative commons.</p><p>So, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what exactly are creative commons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>To hold the copyright to a creative work means that you own it, and anybody who wants to use your work for anything (i.e. uses a song you composed in their YouTube video) has to do so on your terms. When you license your work through creative commons you do not give up your rights to your creative work (a common misconception).</p><p>When you use a creative commons license you are outlining the terms under which other creators are allowed to use your creations in their projects for free if they credit you for your work.</p><p>If you do not want anyone using your work for free in any context, you stick to traditional copyrighting.</p><p>But if you’ve created a piece of music, a photograph, or a clip that you wouldn’t mind other people using, potentially as a way to get your name out there, you might want to consider creative commons.</p><p>There are 6 different creative commons licenses. Which is right for you will depend on your answers to these two questions:</p><p>Are you okay with a creator making money off of something they create using your work?</p><p>Are you okay with a creator producing a derivative of your work?</p><p>To say ‘no derivatives’ is to say ‘I’m okay with people using it, so long as they don’t change it’. One example of a derivative is a techno remix of a song. If you are alright with other creators making derivatives of your work, you may also want to require them to ‘ShareAlike’. ShareAlike means that the creator of that techno remix of your song has to use the same creative commons license you used for your original to distribute the remix.</p><p>An example of a derivative someone might make of a YouTube video would be auto-tuning it to make a song or cutting up your video to make one that’s just ‘the funny parts’.</p><p>Here are the 6 creative commons licenses, and a chart you can use as a quick reference tool.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Attribution-–-CC-BY"><a href="#Attribution-–-CC-BY" class="headerlink" title="Attribution – CC BY"></a>Attribution – CC BY</h2><p>If you’re using music or other media with this license, all you need to do is credit the artist.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can do whatever they like with any element of it (video or sound) so long as they credit you. I.e. if someone wanted to mute your clips and use you as stock footage in a bigger project, they could.</p><h2 id="Attribution-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-SA"><a href="#Attribution-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-SA" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-ShareAlike – CC BY-SA"></a>Attribution-ShareAlike – CC BY-SA</h2><p>If you use music, photos, or any other media licensed this way, then you must both credit the artist and license your video this same way. Meaning, you can’t use YouTube’s standard license and must instead allow for others to use your work the way you are using the licensed media.</p><p>If you apply this license to your video, you’re saying you don’t mind people using all or portions of your video for their project so long as they allow others to use their work in the same way.</p><h2 id="Attribution-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-ND"><a href="#Attribution-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-ND" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NoDerivs – CC BY-ND"></a>Attribution-NoDerivs – CC BY-ND</h2><p>This one can get tricky.</p><p>Essentially, you can use media licensed this way so long as you don’t alter it or create a different version. For example, you can’t take a song licensed this way and use it in a mashup with another song. That part is clear. Where it gets tricky is when you want to use a song in your video.</p><p>Under normal copyright rules, using a royalty-free song in the background of your video would not count as creating a derivative. The definition of derivative according to creative commons is a bit broader and includes ‘syncing’. This means you can’t take an ‘Attribution-NoDerivs’ song and create any kind of music video for it.</p><p>For example, you can’t edit clips of yourself snowboarding so that they’re in sync with a song that has this license.</p><p>Whether or not you can play the song in the background of your vlog while you are speaking can be a bit of a grey area. In theory, it shouldn’t be a problem, but if you’re accessing the music through a social site like SoundCloud then it might be best to ask the artist first.</p><p>There’s no reason to license your YouTube videos this way. If people cannot alter your video, all that’s left is for them to repost it. Even though they’d also be crediting you, they’d still essentially be stealing views and ad revenue from your original video.</p><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-–-CC-BY-NC"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-–-CC-BY-NC" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial – CC BY-NC"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial – CC BY-NC</h2><p>If you’re using stock footage, music, or stock photos licensed this way then you should still be able to monetize your video. YouTube monetization and commercial use are different things. However, there is a lot of confusion about this issue, and chances are the rights holder intends for this license to mean ‘no monetization’.</p><p>What you definitely could not do with a NonCommercial license is to use the song&#x2F;other media in an actual commercial for a product, including product placement that a brand is paying you for.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can use it in whatever way they like so long as they credit you and don’t try to make money off of it. Once again, that doesn’t mean they can’t use it in a YouTube video which they monetize because, technically, they’d be making money off of the ad that ran ahead of the video and not the video itself.</p><p>The thing to be careful of with this license is that it’s not ‘ShareAlike’. So, if you license your video this way somebody could use your clips as stock footage and then provide them - as part of their project – for free to a third person to use in a project they were making money off of.</p><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-NC-SA"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-NC-SA" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike – CC BY-NC-SA"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike – CC BY-NC-SA</h2><p>Music and other media with an ‘Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike’ license can be used in and altered for your videos, so long as you aren’t making money off those videos. You must also use this same license for the video you create using elements licensed this way.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can use it or a portion of it in their project if they credit you. They must also use this same license for their video if they do. This protects you from the situation where a third person who never licensed your original content is making money off of it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-NC-ND"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-NC-ND" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs – CC BY-NC-ND"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs – CC BY-NC-ND</h2><p>There aren’t many situations where you would be using media licensed this way in your YouTube videos.

Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.</p><p> These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let’s explore different ways of improving your video making skills.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos</h2><p> All videographers agree that you shouldn’t come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.</p><h4 id="1-Write-the-Script"><a href="#1-Write-the-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Write the Script"></a>1. Write the Script</h4><p> Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don’t have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don’t have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.</p><h4 id="2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included"><a href="#2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included" class="headerlink" title="2. Build the Set (Lighting included)"></a>2. Build the Set (Lighting included)</h4><p> Don’t leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can’t at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Batteries Charged"></a>3. Keep Your Batteries Charged</h4><p> There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.</p><h4 id="4-Do-a-Microphone-Check"><a href="#4-Do-a-Microphone-Check" class="headerlink" title="4. Do a Microphone Check"></a>4. Do a Microphone Check</h4><p> Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That’s why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >Check out the best microphone for YouTuber in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition"><a href="#5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition" class="headerlink" title="5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition"></a>5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition</h4><p> The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.</p><p> This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you’ll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.</p><h4 id="6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode"><a href="#6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6.

YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="7. Eliminate The Background Noises"></a>7. Eliminate The Background Noises</h4><p> Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus"></a>8. Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.</p><p> In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.</p><p> We have chosen some of the <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html" >best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.</p><p> The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video’s aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Videos without Any Software Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Hopefully, the tips we provided in this article are going to help you create better YouTube videos.

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2.

Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions. Well, now YouTube is letting you know exactly which area to focus on. Simply hover over any “?” icon to see the advice and click “Learn More” to go to YouTube Creator Academy to get more details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-optimization.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta Optimization Tips"                ></p><h4 id="2-Recent-Video-Data"><a href="#2-Recent-Video-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.

If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014854/22899" target="_top" id="2014854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014854/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving. Having better data and understanding of how an individual video or an entire channel is performing will help creators succeed on this ever more competitive platform.</p><p><em>Have you tried the new YouTube Studio (Beta)?

As long as you have some reliable subscribers leaving comments on your videos you should be able to schedule a live stream and know it will have an audience. People feel a personal connection with their favorite vloggers so if you give your subscribers a chance to interact with you in real time they will probably plan to join in. The key to a good live streaming is to respond to comments and questions from people who are watching. Besides watching the live chat of your video you can create a hashtag for your stream and monitor it on twitter.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Why Livestream?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Type of Content to Livestream</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part6"><strong>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</strong></a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Livestream"><a href="#Why-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Why Livestream?"></a>Why Livestream?</h2><p>You have grown your audience, and now you want to take your channel to the next level and diversify your content.</p><p>Whether you are vlogging, gaming, or running tutorials on YouTube, there is potential to host a live broadcast. It’s not limited to any genre, you simply need to create content that people are interested in watching.</p><p>Before we get started into the How, let’s start with a few reasons Why you should be live streaming your content.</p><h4 id="Connect-and-engage-with-your-audience"><a href="#Connect-and-engage-with-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="Connect and engage with your audience"></a>Connect and engage with your audience</h4><p>When a viewer leaves a comment during a livestream you will be able to see it right away and respond. Having an instantaneous conversation with a viewer while they are watching your video will encourage more engagement and establish a ber relationship with your viewers — and you will know that these viewers are not bots.</p><h4 id="Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel"><a href="#Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel" class="headerlink" title="Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel"></a>Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel</h4><p>If you are making YouTube videos on average 10 minutes long, and the viewer only watches half of it, that’s only 5 minutes of watch time, which is fine… But if you are live streaming for 45 minutes, and you are able to hold the viewer’s attention, you can surpass what your regular videos can do.</p><h4 id="Make-videos-faster"><a href="#Make-videos-faster" class="headerlink" title="Make videos faster"></a>Make videos faster</h4><p>As a YouTuber, you are always striving to be more efficient. Live streaming allows you to do that as you can set up and go. The content you end up creating during the duration of your livestream can then also be condensed into a highlight reel or a recap.</p><p>With a bit of planning before you go live, you can create a week’s worth of content in one go, instead of having multiple schedules for livestream content and your standard publishing videos.</p><h2 id="Type-of-Content-to-Livestream"><a href="#Type-of-Content-to-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Type of Content to Livestream"></a>Type of Content to Livestream</h2><p>Live streaming has a lot of value, but what type of content should you be streaming?</p><p>Here are a few popular ideas for content that will attract viewers to your livestream:</p><h4 id="Q-A-session"><a href="#Q-A-session" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A session"></a><strong>Q&amp;A session</strong></h4><h4 id="Unboxing"><a href="#Unboxing" class="headerlink" title="Unboxing"></a><strong>Unboxing</strong></h4><h4 id="Game-or-challenge"><a href="#Game-or-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Game or challenge"></a><strong>Game or challenge</strong></h4><h4 id="Sneak-preview-or-review"><a href="#Sneak-preview-or-review" class="headerlink" title="Sneak preview or review"></a><strong>Sneak preview or review</strong></h4><h4 id="Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it"><a href="#Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it" class="headerlink" title="Live events (just make sure the Internet can support it)"></a><strong>Live events</strong> (just make sure the Internet can support it)</h4><h4 id="A-demo-or-a-tutorial"><a href="#A-demo-or-a-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="A demo or a tutorial"></a><strong>A demo or a tutorial</strong></h4><h4 id="A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video"><a href="#A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video" class="headerlink" title="A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video"></a><strong>A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video</strong></h4><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Livestream On YouTube"></a>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</h2><h4 id="A-Plan-or-Outline"><a href="#A-Plan-or-Outline" class="headerlink" title="A Plan or Outline"></a>A Plan or Outline</h4><p>It’s good to know what your livestream is going to be about before you start. Is there a key message you want to hit, an action you want your viewers to take, or a structure you want to follow.</p><p>Just because it’s live, doesn’t mean it all has to be improvised. If you go in without a plan, you might end up feeling flustered or getting stressed out. Allow for spontaneous comments or events to take you off your initial plan, but always return to your outline so you know how to wrap up your livestream when you have to.</p><h4 id="Stable-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Stable-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Stable Internet Connection"></a>Stable Internet Connection</h4><p>You cannot conduct a quality livestream, if your Internet is bad. When evaluating your internet connection for live streaming on YouTube, look at the Upload speed. Depending on the quality of your video, these are the minimum upload speed rates your Internet will need to perform:</p><p>480p &#x3D; 1.5 mbps</p><p>720p &#x3D; 3 mbps</p><p>1080 &#x3D; 5 mbps</p><p>In addition, be aware of external causes that may be slowing down your internet such as someone else using it, a poorly performing router, or a damaged cable.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p>If you have a smartphone or a laptop with a webcam built in, that is the best camera for you to get started live streaming. It’s good to have a milestone and work towards a more advanced camera, but until then, don’t feel discouraged because you don’t have expensive gear. If you have a smartphone, a laptop, or a basic webcam, that’s perfectly fine.</p><h4 id="Microphone"><a href="#Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Microphone"></a>Microphone</h4><p>You don’t need a great microphone for live streaming, you only need a good one. If you do want to spend several hundred to a thousand dollars for a professional studio microphone, nobody will stop you, but know this, a mic that is easy to use is as important as the audio quality as you develop a consistent live streaming schedule.</p><h4 id="Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>Once upon a time, to livestream on YouTube, you needed additional software to capture content from desktop, camera, microphone, etc, called encoding software — but not anymore.</p><p>Those encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wirecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VMix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are required if you are producing content that requires a high frame rate such as gaming, but not mandatory if you are simply vlogging or running a tutorial.</p><p>If you are using Chrome, you can<a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/youtube-rolls-out-a-new-feature-that-lets-you-go-live-from-the-desktop-without-an-encoder/" >stream live on YouTube without using an encoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>You will need a capture card when you are capturing footage from a different PC or console. If you are a gamer and you are using one PC to stream and one PC to play your game, then you should consider getting a capture card.</p><h2 id="4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube"></a>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</h2><p>There are 4 main ways you can start live streaming on YouTube.

Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)</strong></h4><p>Another way to livestream without an encoding software is by using the Google Hangouts On Air feature.</p><p>This is great if you want the feel of your livestream to be similar to a board meeting, where you can invite people, split screen, and share screen to illustrate your point.</p><p>Here’s how you can access this Google Hangouts On Air:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Events under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click New Live Event button on the top right corner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-live-event-button2.jpg"                      alt="new live event button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the event’s Info and Setting page.

Mobile"></a><strong>3. Mobile</strong></h4><p>Live streaming via your mobile device gives you a lot more freedom to maneuver. You can walk around and give your viewers a tour — but remember to stay within the WiFi or LTE range. That means you still won’t be able to livestream well inside an elevator.</p><p>Here’s how you can livestream on mobile:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the YouTube app and make sure you are signed in to the account you want to livestream from.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: At the top, click on the camera icon</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on Go Live</p><p>  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When live streaming, always hold your smartphone horizontally. This allows your video to be oriented as a landscape, instead of a portrait.</p><h4 id="4-Custom-Encoder"><a href="#4-Custom-Encoder" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom Encoder"></a><strong>4. Custom Encoder</strong></h4><p>The fourth way of live streaming on YouTube is with encoding software. This is the recommended method if video quality is essential, such as gaming videos.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install an encoding software. In this example, we’ll be using <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open OBS</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Go to YouTube Creator Studio and enter the Stream Now page</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-studio4.jpg"                      alt="youtube creator studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123477/16836" target="_top" id="2123477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123477/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Under Encoder Setup, copy Stream name&#x2F;key (Warning: DO NOT share this key with anyone)</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Return to OBS and enter the Setting menu on the lower right-hand side of the application</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click into the Stream tab</p><p>a) Under Stream Type, select Streaming Services</p><p>b) Under Service, select YouTube&#x2F;YouTube Gaming</p><p>c) Under Server, select Primary YouTube ingest server</p><p>d) In Stream Key box, paste the Stream Key you copied from YouTube</p><p>e) Click Apply and then OK</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Plug in your webcam</p><p><strong>Step 8</strong>: In the main OBS dashboard, under the Sources menu, click the + icon and add Video Capture Device.

Check out from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h4 id="Have-Good-Lighting"><a href="#Have-Good-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Have Good Lighting"></a>Have Good Lighting</h4><p>Be aware of your surroundings when you are about to livestream. You don’t need the top-notch lighting kit, you can simply sit beside a window and allow natural lights to illuminate your stream.</p><h4 id="Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted"><a href="#Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted" class="headerlink" title="Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)"></a>Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)</h4><p>Have a technical rehearsal by doing a livestream test, then rewatching it, and evaluating the quality of the audio and visual.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about your audience logging in and seeing your test if you set the Privacy of the stream to Unlisted.</p><h4 id="Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen"><a href="#Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Look at the Lens, Not the Screen"></a>Look at the Lens, Not the Screen</h4><p>If you are streaming with the selfie camera on your smartphone or using your camera’s viewfinder to make sure you are in the frame, remember that you need to be looking at the lens — not the image of yourself.</p><p>Eye contact is important in building trust, and if you are looking at yourself, it will appear as if you are looking past your viewers instead of at them.</p><h4 id="Show-It-To-Your-Viewers"><a href="#Show-It-To-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="Show It To Your Viewers"></a>Show It To Your Viewers</h4><p>Whatever you are talking about, if you can, show it to your viewers. YouTube is a visual medium, and that means your viewers can become disinterested if there’s nothing visual holding their attention.</p><p>In the beginning, you probably won’t have a multi-camera setup, so you cannot cut away from your livestream. However, you can share the screen and you can bring physical objects into a frame.</p><p>If you are talking about your dog, show her on camera. If you’re presenting something with a lot of steps, create a Powerpoint slideshow.</p><p>Consider what visuals or props you can add to your livestream to enhance your performance.</p><h4 id="Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen"><a href="#Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen" class="headerlink" title="Find A Way to Make it Evergreen"></a>Find A Way to Make it Evergreen</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing" >Evergreen content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>refers to content that is relevant for a great length of time. Talking about an event isn’t evergreen, because the event will soon pass and become old news. However, giving some tips for how to plan an event would be evergreen content.</p><p>Since your livestream will be saved on YouTube and your viewers can replay and watch it. They’re more likely to enjoy it if the content is relevant and interesting.</p><h4 id="It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long"><a href="#It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long" class="headerlink" title="It Doesn’t Have to Be Long"></a>It Doesn’t Have to Be Long</h4><p>A livestream doesn’t need to be 40 minutes long. It only needs to be long enough for you to get your story across — and if you want to answer some questions and engage with your audience. As soon as your story is over, even if it’s only 5 minutes, that’s okay. Don’t stress about the length of your stream, it’s not an endurance competition.</p><h4 id="Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes"><a href="#Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes"></a>Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes</h4><p>Another thing you shouldn’t worry about at all is making mistakes. When you are doing livestreams pretend you are engaging with someone in real life. In real life, you aren’t able to edit out your mistakes, whether it’s a word mispronounced or coffee spilling. Roll with it and laugh it off.</p><h2 id="How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube"></a>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</h2><h4 id="Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming"><a href="#Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Let People Know When You Are Streaming"></a>Let People Know When You Are Streaming</h4><p>Give people enough time to schedule it in, don’t spring it on them in the last minute.
