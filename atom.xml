Besides, it is the best way for your audience to quickly find your videos as the keywords will directly link them.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-go-overboard-3"><a href="#5-Don’t-go-overboard-3" class="headerlink" title="5) Don’t go overboard"></a>5) Don’t go overboard</h4><p>Even though there are no limits on words for YouTube tags, don’t use so many words; it may turn away your audience.

Going overboard may automatically take you off the topic and mislead your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-add-a-tag-to-a-YouTube-video-3"><a href="#How-to-add-a-tag-to-a-YouTube-video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to add a tag to a YouTube video"></a>How to add a tag to a YouTube video</h2><p>Adding the right YouTube tag will increase the chances of YouTubers finding and watching your video.

YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p><p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p><p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams.

This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p><p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode.

Customizing a YouTube Live or any other screencasting session with this video editing software is easy, and you can choose the resolution, frame rate, or even if you want to show mouse clicks in the recording.</p><p>Capturing the webcam feed and the computer’s screen simultaneously is also an option, while you can also decide whether or not you want to record audio from a microphone, computer audio, or both at the same time.</p><p>What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys. Once you are done recording the live stream you shared on YouTube, you can edit the footage you created before uploading it to your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="4-Wondershare-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-Wondershare-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4.

But with no experience or training, it’s hard to know how to start a vlog and make money.</p><p>Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!</p><p>This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel. You’ll learn everything you need to know, from finding your niche and the best ways to promote your vlog. Once your vlog starts getting views, you’ll see how to turn your viewers into subscribers, make money, and become a YouTube sensation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg"                      alt="start vlog and make money"                ></p><p><strong>Background of vlogs on YouTube</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg"                      alt="background of vlogs on youtube"                ></p><p>What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube.

(what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><h3 id="Patreon"><a href="#Patreon" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!</p><h2 id="Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube"></a>Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</h2><p>Vloggers on YouTube are earning some big money.

Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving-1"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving-1" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today.

You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality-1"><a href="#Content-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads-1"><a href="#YouTube-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134249" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134249/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing-1"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997675/19272" target="_top" id="1997675">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997675" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997675/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers.

What is the best topic for vlogging?"></a>2. What is the best topic for vlogging?</h3><p>There isn’t a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger’s most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person’s personality, interests, and preferences.</p><h3 id="3-What-equipment-do-I-need-to-start-vlogging-1"><a href="#3-What-equipment-do-I-need-to-start-vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

It is evident that a video must have a perfect soundtrack for video masterpieces, but ensuring it is copyright free music is a must.</p><p>It is because you would never want YouTube to remove your video due to copyright violation after working so hard on it. Fortunately, there are a few trusted resources that offer perfect royalty free music for youtube videos.</p><p>Here is a list of 10 best royalty free music for videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</strong></a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?"></a>Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?</h2><p>‘Royalty free’ does not mean that the artist has given up ownership of their music, just that they have licensed it for others to use. Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a ‘music by’ note in your video’s description.</p><p>Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube’s flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-YouTube-Audio-Library"><a href="#1-YouTube-Audio-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

Here are five tips for naming your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="1-Keep-it-Short-and-Impressive"><a href="#1-Keep-it-Short-and-Impressive" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it Short and Impressive"></a>1. Keep it Short and Impressive</h4><p>In order to be memorable, your channel name should be short and catchy. Generally, it is a bad idea to have a name that is more than five syllables long. Longer channel names are both harder to remember, and harder to tell your friends about since they do not tend to roll off the tongue.</p><p>The worst way you can end up with an overly long username is by adding numbers or extra letters to the end of it. People often decide to do this because their desired channel name was taken. It is always a terrible idea. Your username might still look short, but that is deceptive. A username like ‘Lucas423’ is really ‘Lucasfourtwentythree’. Nobody will remember the exact numbers. If anyone remembers that username at all they will only remember ‘Lucas’, which will make it extremely difficult for them to find your channel again.</p><p>For the sake of keeping their channel names short and memorable, some successful YouTubers have actually made up words, i.e ‘Smosh’. This only works if a silly made-up word suits the tone of your channel, and even a lot of made-up words are taken by this point.</p><h4 id="2-It’s-All-About-You"><a href="#2-It’s-All-About-You" class="headerlink" title="2. It’s All About You"></a>2. It’s All About You</h4><p>Regardless of the topic of your vlog, your vlog will also be about you as a personality, so your channel name should have something to do with who you are as a person. It can even include your real name or some variation of it. Real-life nicknames work great.</p><p>If you do not want to use your actual name, or do not think your actual name would stick in people’s minds very well, then think about what your hobbies are and what kind of words could be used to describe you. Come up with a list of nouns and describing words and try out different combinations. You might even decide to try out some of your describing words with your real name.</p><h4 id="3-It’s-Also-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-It’s-Also-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. It’s Also About Your Audience"></a>3. It’s Also About Your Audience</h4><p>Your name should reflect who you are, but it should also be relevant to the people who will be watching your vlog. For example, people who are tuning in to a daily life vlog might appreciate it if you use your real name or some variation on your name. People who are tuning into a vlog to learn something – beauty or cooking tips, for example – will be confused if your channel name is something like ‘LucasIsCool’. If you have a channel that is about anything besides your daily life, experiences, or opinions then your channel name needs to reference your topic. If Lucas’s channel is about baking then rather than ‘LucasIsCool’ he should try something like ‘LucasBakes’ or ‘CookiesByLucas’.</p><h4 id="4-Test-Drive-It"><a href="#4-Test-Drive-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Test Drive It"></a>4. Test Drive It</h4><p>It is a bad idea to rush over to YouTube and sign up for the first channel name you decide you like. First, say it out loud and see if it sounds as catchy as it seemed in your head. If it does, then there are still a couple of other “test drives” you need to do.</p><p>Plunk the channel name you are considering into a search engine to make sure it is not already strongly associated with something besides you. If there is actually a website with your channel name as its URL then you should almost definitely discard that name and choose a new one. If you have some success with your vlog then you will probably want to acquire the associated URL later on. Even if you do not think you want a website it is a bad idea to choose a channel name that already has a strong association with something else. For example, if you play music on your channel and your channel has the same name as a music festival people might automatically think you and that festival are affiliated.</p><p>You will also want to check and make sure nobody is using your channel name as their username on Instagram, Vimeo, or any other social media site. If your name is already being used elsewhere then it will be difficult for you to expand.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Give-up"><a href="#5-Don’t-Give-up" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Give up"></a>5. Don’t Give up</h4><p>YouTube is a huge site and a lot of the really good names are already being used or – more frustratingly – have been taken by people who are not actually using them. The first few names you come up with will probably be unavailable. This is where a lot of YouTubers get discouraged and start weakening their channel name by typing numbers after it. It is easy to get pulled into settling for any name that sort of sounds like the one you want, but which is actually available. Do not do this! You will be able to create a catchy, unique, name that is all you own.</p><p>Coming up with the perfect name for your channel can take time, sometimes a lot of time. If you can get it done in one evening then you are lucky because this is something that can take days. The name of your YouTube channel is extremely important and you should take as long as you need to pick a good one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Free-Online-YouTube-Name-Generators-in-2021"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Free-Online-YouTube-Name-Generators-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Free Online YouTube Name Generators in 2021"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Free Online YouTube Name Generators in 2021</h2><h4 id="1-YouTube-Name-Generator"><a href="#1-YouTube-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="1.

While the flip side of that is that not choosing a good channel name can really hurt your chances of getting views and subscribers. Your videos might be great, but if viewers who like them cannot remember your name then it will be hard for them to find you again. Other videos of yours might even show up in their searches and be ignored because the viewer does not recognize your name. Also, while the very best channel names make people curious about what you do, the very worst channel names will be a deterrent for people when they are deciding whether to watch your videos. For example, including a sequence of numbers after your name will give people on YouTube the impression that you do not know what you are doing.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Guide: How to Improve Search Rankings For Your YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Get More Subscribers on YouTube &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-YouTube-Channel-Name"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-YouTube-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change YouTube Channel Name"></a>Part 4: How to Change YouTube Channel Name</h2><p>YouTube does allow you to change the name that is displayed for your channel now (in the past you could not). However, while your display name can be changed, the URL of your channel is permanent. If you change your display name then the two things will no longer match. Also if you manage to build up a following using one name you will probably lose some of those people if you change it. If you feel like your channel name is holding you back then you should definitely update it to something better, but you should also consider whether it is holding you back enough that it is worth losing some of the regular viewers you already have. It probably will be, if you feel like your channel will start growing faster after the change.</p><p>Even after selecting the best name for your YouTube channel, if one day you realize that it must be modified to have much better results; you can definitely change it without deleting the existing account. Note that your Google account name is the same as your YouTube Channel name. So, whenever you want to change the name of the channel; you can follow these simple steps to execute this task:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, simply sign in to YouTube.com and then hit on the Settings icon option available on the top right corner of your screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now go to the settings button and then choose the “Edit on Google” link.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is time to enter the updated Channel name and then finally hit the Ok button on the screen.</p><p>You are done with it, and now you can visit your YouTube channel once again to see the new name appearing on it.</p><p>Note: changing the channel name in this way will change all your names across Google services, such as Gmail and Google Drive.

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4.

Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144279/7443" target="_top" id="2144279">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144279" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144279/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.

The outline serves as a guide that will make the finished product better compared to when you just tried to wing it. One tip on how to write a script for a YouTube video is to have an outline for the beginning, middle, and ending of the video. Once you have all the elements of the story, then you can start with the first draft of the script.</p><h3 id="2-Set-the-tone"><a href="#2-Set-the-tone" class="headerlink" title="2. Set the tone"></a>2. Set the tone</h3><p>The tone you pick for the video will depend on your audience. It’s safe to assume that viewers want something that’s unique, informative, and engaging. In some cases, they look for a video that’s personal, and they can relate to it. Humor is also something that you should consider when writing a script.</p><h3 id="3-Just-keep-writing"><a href="#3-Just-keep-writing" class="headerlink" title="3. Just keep writing"></a>3. Just keep writing</h3><p>When you start writing it is important that you keep on doing it no matter what happens. Just write down everything that comes into your mind. After that, read what you’ve written. If you think that something needs to be replaced, then replace it. If you get more inspiration and think that the script is lacking, then add to it.</p><h3 id="4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured"><a href="#4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure that the script is well structured"></a>4. Make sure that the script is well structured</h3><p>It’s important to learn how to write a script that is well structured. Divide the script into four parts: Opening, Primer, Body, and Closing.</p><p>For the Opening part, ask a simple question that can be answered in the Body. Use the Primer section to inform viewers what they should expect from the video. The Body will contain the main content of the video. It should cover all the things that viewers need to know. Lastly, the closing wraps up the video by providing social media details and a teaser for the next video.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep It Concise</strong></li></ul><p>In a personal vlog-style video you might ramble and go off on amusing tangents, and that’s something viewers love within that genre. If you are trying to teach, however, your viewers will benefit more if you keep things concise and direct.</p><p>Tell people up front what point you are trying to make before you jump into making it.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Interactive</strong></li></ul><p>Talk to people, not at them.</p><p>While you are scripting and focusing on the information you want to deliver, it’s easy to forget to be personal.</p><p>Remember to refer to your audience as ‘you’, not ‘you guys’ (you are speaking to individual viewers, not a collective) and to include moments of engagement throughout your videos. Ask your viewers questions to keep their minds active, this also encourages them to leave comments.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304648">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304648%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304648/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script"><a href="#After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script" class="headerlink" title="After Writing your YouTube Video Script"></a>After Writing your YouTube Video Script</h2><p>After writing the script, the next step is to invite a trusted friend or family member to look at the script.

The higher the percentage, the more people are watching your entire video.</p><p>If you get above <strong>60%</strong> Average Percentage Viewed, you should feel very proud. In our modern world with our short attention span, that is considered good retention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-one.png"                      alt="audience-retention-one"                ></p><p>In the example above, we see that on average, a viewer will only see 44% of the video.

It’s good data to help you improve your introduction and the hook.</p><p>If there is important information that you are presenting at a given point and in the Audience Retention you see that only a small percentage of your viewers actually see it, then for the next video, you might want to position the details in a different point in the video.</p><h3 id="How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Improve Audience Retention</strong></h3><p>Here are a few ways you can retain your audience’s attention if you noticed a drop in viewership:</p><p><strong>- Film a hook</strong> (introduce your video to let the audience know what to expect)</p><p><strong>- Add b-roll</strong> (having supplemental footage to cut to makes your video more interesting to watch)</p><p><strong>- Have a co-host</strong> (Having someone on screen gives the video more dynamic interactions)</p><p><strong>- Edit out the unimportant stuff</strong></p><p><strong>- Write a conclusion</strong> (having a conclusion prepared will allow you to transition from the content of the video to the call to action without the audience even knowing) See this example by PolyMatter below and notice how seamless their ending is.</p><p>If you have a video that is doing a good job retaining the audience, then replicate it.

You should pay attention to the relevance of keywords.</p><p>Even when you add closed captions, it doesn’t mean the best keywords are present to the Youtube search engine when we speak.</p><p>That is why it is important to know your audience and what words and phrases they are going to use to search for your video.</p><p>Here is how you can see what keywords were used to find your video:</p><ol><li>Enter YouTube Studio in your channel</li><li>Access Analytics</li><li>Select Reach</li><li>Click into Traffic Source</li><li>Click Traffic Source: YouTube Search</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/traffic-source-youtube-search.png.png"                      alt="traffic-source"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151889/7443" target="_top" id="2151889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you want to find some new keywords for your upcoming video, you will need to do some research.</p><p><strong>1. Enter Keywords You Want to Rank for In YouTube Search:</strong> This allows you to see what the most popular phrases are in the YouTube search engine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/search-for-keywords.png"                      alt="search-for-keywords"                ></p><p><strong>2. Study the Competitors:</strong> See which videos are ranking high for your search term. Use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keywords that the top videos are performing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/vidlq-tool.jpg"                      alt="vidlq-tool"                ></p><p><strong>3. Search for Related Keywords and Evaluate Relevancy:</strong> A tool called <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>can help you find related keywords and allow you to identify the search volume, cost per click (aka CPC is used for determining the budget for paid search), and the competitiveness of the word or phrase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="ubersuggest"                ></p><p><strong>Search volume:</strong> The number of searches with that particular keyword. The higher the number the more popular it is. You should aim to use keywords with a high search volume.</p><p><strong>Keyword competition score:</strong> This score is usually indicated by a number and it represents how difficult it is for a keyword to rank due to other pages already ranking for that word or phrase. You want to find a keyword with a low competition score.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The best combination is high search volume and low competition score. But if you can’t get that perfect mix, go for the low competitive score, as it will give you a better chance to rank, even if it isn’t searched as often.</p><p><strong>4. Come Up With Content Related to Those Keywords:</strong> To come up with topic ideas around a keyword, you can use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://answerthepublic.com/" >Answer the Public <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which gives you all the most popular questions searched online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/answer-the-public.jpg"                      alt="answer-the-public"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Engage-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Engage-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage Your Audience:"></a><strong>3. Engage Your Audience:</strong></h2><p>It’s been highly discussed on forums all over the Internet, and there appears to be a strong correlation between <a class="link"   href="https://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors" >YouTube video ranking and the number of likes, dislikes, and comments <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the video received.</p><p>While YouTube itself might not be using the number of likes and comments to determine where your video rank, having high engagement allows your video to be discovered through other means.</p><p>Here is an example of how it would work:</p><p>- A YouTuber with 100,000 subscribers views your video and likes it</p><p>- Then your video might be visible to a fraction of those 100,000 subscribers.</p><p>- Boom! Domino effect!</p><p>- More people will see your video and like it, increasing your network of viewers and your watch time, which is one of the main factors that YouTube takes into consideration.</p><p> <strong>Get engagements with a call to action</strong>:</p><p>- Don’t be afraid to ask for an engagement at the beginning of the video to avoid fall off on retention.</p><p>- Encourage them to leave a comment or start a discussion by asking a question at the end of your video.</p><p>- Monitor comments and responds to them so you can build a relationship with your audience over time.</p><p>It’s all about creating a community and that is what YouTube encourages.</p><h2 id="4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length"><a href="#4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length" class="headerlink" title="4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:"></a><strong>4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:</strong></h2><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on watch time, and in addition to that, it puts more weight on session watch time.</p><p>Session watch time is counted when people watch your video and then continue to watch others, it doesn’t have to be your own. The more time people spend watching YouTube videos, as a result of your content, the more likely YouTube will increase your ranking.</p><p>Since YouTube puts importance on time spent watching videos, the length of your video will play a key role.</p><p>If you have 5 videos and all of them are a minute long, a 100% watch through will only get you 5 minutes total.</p><p>However, if you have 1 video that is 20 minutes, and an average viewer only watches half of it, then you have an average watch time of over 10 minutes. <strong>That’s more than double what your five short videos can do.</strong> This longer video is worth more. However, if that 20-minute video is really boring and people drop off in the first minute, then it’s not any better than 1 of the 5 short videos.</p><p>If your format allows, go for a longer video instead of a shorter one. But the most important thing is that you can keep people watching your videos: so use end screen and playlist links to keep them engaged.</p><p><strong>End screen:</strong> Pick related videos for your audience, so they know exactly what they should watch next. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a background template for your end screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/related-videos-for-your-audience.jpg"                      alt="related-videos-for-your-audience"                ></p><p><strong>Playlist</strong>: If you have multiple videos that fit a specific topic, add them to a playlist so the viewer can enjoy them all in one viewing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist.jpg"                      alt="add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist"                ></p><h4 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4><ol><li>Use <strong>Audience Retention</strong> to better understand how to structure your video for the best results.</li><li>Perform <strong>Keyword Research</strong> to find the keywords that your competitors are using and your audience is searching for.</li><li><strong>Increasing Subscribers</strong> gets your video in front of more people the moment it is published.</li><li><strong>Encourage Comments</strong> and respond to establish a relationship with your viewers.</li><li>Ensure that <strong>Viewers Continue Watching</strong> videos on YouTube after they finish watching yours.</li></ol><h2 id="Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking"></a><strong>Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking</strong></h2><p>Except for the above-mentioned factors, there are also other issues that affect the ranking of your YouTube video. YouTube has stated that the number of subscribers doesn’t play a key role in your video ranking.</p><p>For example, if a YouTuber has a million subscribers and then overnight they lose 100 thousand, a video they had ranking number 1 will still be ranked number 1.</p><p>However, the number of subscribers has a lot of indirect effects on your channel.</p><p>- Subscribers know the moment your video is published</p><p>- Subscribers will watch your video in the first week (YouTube will rank your video higher if they see a lift in the first week of publishing)</p><p>- YouTube put a higher value on subscribers than views and social shares, because it’s harder to fake subscribers</p><p>Growing subscribers take time and effort, and even though it shouldn’t be your main focus, there are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tactics you can do to gain more subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t miss a chance to optimize your YouTube video, download, and print out this checklist for your next video project.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1.

Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p><p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand the Reddiquettes"></a>3. Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p><p>- Consume the content before voting.</p><p>- Act as you would in real life.</p><p>- And more.</p><h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

The colors, music, and graphics you use in your intro should all be related to the theme and tone of your vlog.</p><p>Your intro is your chance to make a great first impression. A good one lets viewers know what kind of experience they can expect to have if they keep watching your video – whether it’s going to be funny or serious, for example. Having an awesome YouTube intro sequence also helps make your vlog look more like a real show instead of somebody just ranting at their webcam (not that you cannot make a great video that way!).</p><p>Luckily, making a sleek, professional-looking YouTube intro is easy. There are a lot of sites that offer template videos that are either very affordable or completely free. Or, you can make your own intro in your video editing program.

Keep It Under 10 Seconds</strong></p><p>A 10-second intro should have lots of movement and exciting music to hold viewers’ attention. If your intro is more subdued then aim for more than 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>2. Support Your Brand</strong></p><p>One of the most important things your intro can do is strengthen your personal brand. Your intro should look related to your channel art and video thumbnails, but even beyond that, it should match the tone of your content.</p><p><strong>3. Use Music</strong></p><p>When there’s a silent pause in your video the chances of viewers clicking away increase. Make sure your intro includes music that suits the tone of your channel.</p><p><strong>4. Include Your Channel Name</strong></p><p>Your channel name should be a huge, prominent, visual in your intro. This may seem like a given, but there are intros out there where the channel name is either small easy to overlook, or left out completely in favor of a logo.</p><p><strong>5. Do a Cold Open</strong></p><p>On TV, shows usually have at least one scene before they play the theme song. That’s because nobody is tuning in just for the theme, or in your case the intro. Make sure you have at least a short clip before your intro to get viewers interested in the rest of your video. Beyond setting the tone for the rest of the video and introducing your topic, you can use this first clip to create a ‘curiosity gap’. This means generating curiosity and making your viewers feel invested in the video so they stay on the page.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We have listed 16 different YouTube intro makers that you can use conveniently any time you want.

Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done.
