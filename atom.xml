There are 10 different categories including popular channel types like makeup and gaming.</p><p>You have two options for every template: PSD and PNG. If you have Photoshop you’ll be able to edit the PSD file and, if you don’t, you can use the PNG as your banner background when you build your channel art in a free online program like Canva.</p><h4 id="2-Behance"><a href="#2-Behance" class="headerlink" title="2. Behance"></a>2. Behance</h4><p>Behance is a gallery of creative visual works. There is a very large collection of art you could repurpose for your channel art, but some creators on the site have also created graphics specifically to be used as YouTube banners.</p><p>Here are some channel art galleries on Behance: <a class="link"   href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/10819163/Youtube-Background-Art" >Ej &#x2F; Vritra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/11697655/Youtube-Channel-Art" >Austin Evans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can download PSD files from Behance and edit them in Photoshop. There isn’t a PNG or JPG option for people who don’t have Photoshop, though.</p><p>In order to download the templates you’ll need to hover your cursor over the Photoshop icon, and then click ‘Download Now’ when it appears. You’ll need to make an account before you can download.</p><h4 id="3-YourTube"><a href="#3-YourTube" class="headerlink" title="3. YourTube"></a>3. YourTube</h4><p>With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.</p><p>The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium&#x2F;paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).</p><p>Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.</p><h2 id="Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates"><a href="#Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates"></a>Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates</h2><p>In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>1. Wondershare PixStudio</h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#2-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Spark"></a>2. Adobe Spark</h4><p>To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images&#x2F;fonts&#x2F;etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.</p><p>Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).</p><p>The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough.</em></p><h4 id="3-BeFunky"><a href="#3-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="3. BeFunky"></a>3. BeFunky</h4><p>This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. Canva</h4><p>Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.</p><p>The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.</p><h4 id="5-Crello"><a href="#5-Crello" class="headerlink" title="5. Crello"></a>5. Crello</h4><p>Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.</p><p>Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.</p><h4 id="6-Design-Wizard"><a href="#6-Design-Wizard" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Wizard"></a>6. Design Wizard</h4><p>This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.</p><p>Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.</p><h4 id="7-Fotor"><a href="#7-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="7. Fotor"></a>7. Fotor</h4><p>Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.</p><p>There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.</p><h4 id="8-Snappa"><a href="#8-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="8. Snappa"></a>8. Snappa</h4><p>If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.</p><p>Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.</p><h4 id="9-Visme"><a href="#9-Visme" class="headerlink" title="9. Visme"></a>9. Visme</h4><p>Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.</p><p>How did you make your banner? Did you use a channel art template?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/oad-youtube-audio-safely-and-legally-in-3-ways-for-2024/"><u>Download Youtube Audio  Safely & Legally in 3 Ways for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-mastering-the-art-of-youtube-micro-clips/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering the Art of YouTube Micro Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-eras-endwatchers-top-youtube-viewership/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Era's Endwatchers  Top YouTube Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-structuring-videos-for-maximum-impact-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Structuring Videos for Maximum Impact on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-charting-the-future-essential-online-stock-yts/"><u>In 2024, Charting the Future  Essential Online Stock YTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/cting-audio-on-iphone-select-the-best-6-free-software-choices/"><u>Perfecting Audio on iPhone  Select the Best 6 Free Software Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ust-know-about-youtube-shorts-explained/"><u>The Must-Know About YouTube Shorts Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-ultimate-playbook-for-youtube-brand-development-and-expansion/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Playbook for YouTube Brand Development and Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-streamline-visual-marking-in-youtube-posts-with-watermarks-and-logos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamline Visual Marking in Youtube Posts with Watermarks & Logos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-android-mac-video-archiving-a-snap-solution-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Android-Mac Video Archiving  A Snap Solution Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-stream-friendly-tips-for-halo-legends/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Stream-Friendly Tips for Halo Legends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-harmonized-high-res-overlays-for-devices/"><u>[Updated] Harmonized High-Res Overlays for Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/new-free-online-video-combiner-tools-top-picks/"><u>New Free Online Video Combiner Tools Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-best-voice-modification-tools-to-enhance-your-google-meet-experience/"><u>The Ultimate List Best Voice Modification Tools to Enhance Your Google Meet Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-corrupt-excel-2016-workbook-stellar-by-stellar-guide/"><u>How to Repair Corrupt Excel 2016 Workbook? | Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-list-non-youtube-mobile-video-platforms/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate List  Non-YouTube Mobile Video Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-art-of-balance-mastering-tripod-usage-in-video-blogging/"><u>2024 Approved  The Art of Balance  Mastering Tripod Usage in Video Blogging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-deciphering-every-element-in-discord/"><u>In 2024, Deciphering Every Element in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-screen-recording-on-a-dell-workstation/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Screen Recording on a Dell Workstation</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It can be extremely discouraging at first. More experienced vloggers know that mistakes happen and they are no reason to stop recording. Instead of trying to record a perfect clip it is common for vloggers to remove errors from their videos in editing using jump cuts.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1"><a href="#How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog"></a>How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a Jump Cut?"></a>1. What is a Jump Cut?</h4><p>A jump cut is when you jump from one part of your clip to a later part of that same clip, cutting out the section in-between.</p><p>In movies or tv shows jump cuts can be distracting. In vlogs it is the exact opposite; jump cuts are used to remove distractions. It is not strange for a YouTube video to contain a lot of jump cuts. If you go and re-watch a video by your favorite vlogger you will probably notice that every once in a while the vlogger is suddenly sitting differently or that something else has suddenly changed. That is a jump cut, and chances are you did not even think twice about it when you first watched the video.</p><h4 id="2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video"><a href="#2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video"></a>2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video</h4><p>There are a lot of things you might want to take out of your clips using jump cuts. Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>Repetition</strong>: You may have had to repeat yourself because you misspoke. Or, you might watch your clip back and realize that two sections you intended – perhaps even scripted – are very similar and you only need one.</p><p><strong>Off-Topic Tangents</strong>: Once you get comfortable talking to the camera it is easy to find yourself getting off-topic while recording. These tangents might be funny or feel important, but you should still cut them out of your final video. Rather than scrapping them completely, though, consider giving your tangent its very own video. Successful vloggers post new videos frequently, after all.</p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: Use jump cuts to take out any pauses in your video. Every period of silence is an opportunity for viewers to get distracted and decide to click on something else. Adding music to the background of your video can help with shorter pauses, but cutting out any silence is still a good way to go.</p><p>In the video tutorial below, we will share with you some practical and creative jump cuts tips that you can try in video editing. And most of the jump cuts are done with the cutting features in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can download the free trial version below by clicking the Free Download button based on your system.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="3-How-to-Make-Jump-Cuts-in-Vlog-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#3-How-to-Make-Jump-Cuts-in-Vlog-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos"></a>3. How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos</h4><p>You can make jump cuts in almost every editing program, from free software like Windows Movie Maker to professional programs like Adobe Premiere. Remember no matter which video editing software you are using to edit your videos with jump cut, you need to ensure that the software can scroll through your video clips and audio files frame-by-frame. And some video editors may only allow you to scroll video footage frame by frame. This tutorial is for Filmora Video Editor (Now upgraded to Filmora), but many of the same steps will apply to other software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to trim and cut videos in Windows Movie Maker for Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Open up Filmora Video Editor and add a clip into the timeline. Watch it through, and then revisit sections where you think you might want to make cuts.</p><p>Find a place in your clip that has silence and use the scissors icon to cut your clip into two. Then start playing your clip and pause as soon as you hear sound.</p><p>Make sure your clip is selected, and then go back frame by frame until you hear nothing.</p><p>Use the scissors icon to make another cut. You will now have three clips; one before the silence, the silent pause, and the section where sound starts again. Delete the quiet middle clip.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views"><a href="#4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep video shorter for more views"></a>4. Keep video shorter for more views</h4><p>The videos that get the most views on YouTube are an average of three minutes long. People will use the length of a video as a reason not to click on it. Viewers are also more likely to get distracted and stop watching longer videos before they are over. That does not mean you should not take as long as you need to properly explain your ideas, just that you should be careful your video is not longer than it needs to be. It is common for youtubers to use only about a third of the clip they record. The rest is removed using jump cuts.</p><p>Filmora video editor will help you to be more creative in video editing and saving your time at the same time.

Finding Your Money in AdSense"></a>1. Finding Your Money in AdSense</h3><p>Intuitively, many YouTube creators think that the first thing they see when they open up AdSense should be their daily earnings. This is not the case. Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.</p><p>First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.</p><p>In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong> and <strong>AdSense for Content</strong>. AdSense for Content relates to a personal website. For information about your YouTube channel click on <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-performance-report.JPG"                      alt="adsense performance report"                ></p><p>The next page is a report of how much money you have made from monetizing your YouTube channel. Your earnings will be organized by date. The money you see in this report has already had YouTube’s 45% commission deducted.</p><h3 id="2-How-are-my-earnings-determined"><a href="#2-How-are-my-earnings-determined" class="headerlink" title="2. How are my earnings determined?"></a>2. How are my earnings determined?</h3><p>How much money you make through AdSense depends on your <a class="link"   href="https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/" >CPMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.</p><p>CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-get-paid"><a href="#3-How-do-I-get-paid" class="headerlink" title="3. How do I get paid?"></a>3. How do I get paid?</h3><p>There are five different ways to get paid through AdSense: Check, Western Union Quick Cash, Wire Transfer, Rapida, or an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Generally, AdSense will begin the process of paying you your monthly earnings on the 21st of the following month. How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.</p><p>Using <strong>Western Union Quick Cash</strong> you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.</p><p><strong>EFTs</strong> get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.</p><p><strong>Checks</strong> can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.</p><p><strong>Wire Transfers</strong> and <strong>Rapida</strong> can each take up to 15 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg"                      alt="adsense payment"                ></p><p>In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month.

Two of the main platforms are YouTube and Vimeo. This article tells you the difference between both so that you can decide which the best platform is for you. Whether you are a marketer, video producer or gamer you will find the information useful to find your target audience easily.</p><p>Also read:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full Review of Vimeo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Basic, Vimeo Plus or Vimeo Pro: Which is Right for You? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Please watch the video below for more information:</p><h2 id="Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Communities"><a href="#1-Communities" class="headerlink" title="1  Communities"></a>1  Communities</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> When it comes to users YouTube comes out on top with over a billion views each and every month. You are able to interact with your viewers by using the comments and people are able to follow you so that they are notified of new videos and comments. As there is already a huge following on YouTube it’s easy to get a good following if you have great content. It’s harder to control public content which is a downside to using YouTube and there is very little customer support. With the comments being moderated rarely it can cause a distraction from your video. Businesses tend to internally block YouTube video’s which means you won’t get the viewings from people on their lunch breaks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-vs-youtube-communities.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-vs-youtube-communities"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> With higher quality content and no advertisements video owners can quickly build a valid following and gain comments from people that are contributing high value information. You have more detailed analytics which makes it easier to see where you are going wrong should you not have the following you want and you are able to use your own domain. With Google owning YouTube you are unlikely to get the same exposure you would, however the followers tend to be valid giving you a real idea of where you are going right or wrong. Because of the higher quality followers you are less likely to get negative or abusive comments when you use Vimeo, however it is a paid subscription with each tier giving you more space to upload.</p><h4 id="2-Membership"><a href="#2-Membership" class="headerlink" title="2  Membership"></a>2  Membership</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube on the other hand is free for all to use because the main focus is getting their equity through advertisements. There is however the option to take out a subscription which is known as YouTube Red. This lets you watch as many video’s as you want without having to view the ads and also gets you the ability to download so you don’t have to go online to view your favourite videos, a music app and original programming facilities.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> There are 4 different membership options with Vimeo allowing you to tailor it to your needs; there is the basic, plus, pro and business. The higher the cost, the greater level of support and storage capacity you will get. There is a free membership available but you will only be able to use up to 500MB each week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-membership.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-membership"                ></p><h4 id="3-Advertising"><a href="#3-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="3  Advertising"></a>3  Advertising</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> What makes YouTube free is the fact they get their money from the advertisements they put not only on their sites but before video’s that people have to watch a set amount of seconds for before they can view their video of choice. This is great news if you are a marketer as it will allow you to reach out to viewers on video’s that are relevant to your brand&#x2F;product&#x2F;service, however for those that are viewing the sheer amount of ads can be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-advertising.jpg"                      alt="youtube-advertising"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> As a paid subscription service and even the limited free package, you won’t have to view or show viewers ads, which means that your videos are more likely to be seen in their entirety not abandoned due to advertisements.</p><h4 id="4-Updating-video"><a href="#4-Updating-video" class="headerlink" title="4  Updating video"></a>4  Updating video</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> If you upload videos to YouTube you do not have the same benefits as the only way to amend a video is to take it down, delete it and re-upload a new one. This unfortunately takes with it any statistics such as views that you have gained. If you do choose YouTube for your videos then do make sure you check everything vigorously before you upload it as there’s no way to change it.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> Occasionally an uploaded video may need some changes made. This could be due to changes to the offer you have or you have noticed something else that needs amending. With Vimeo if you need to update a video you can do so without losing the statistics it has already gained, which is great news if you notice an error later down the line or need to add or take something away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-uploading.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-uploading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes down to making the final decision between using YouTube or Vimeo you will need to look at the type of audience you want to attract. With Vimeo you are more likely to attract creators and film makers, whereas with YouTube you will have a bigger audience to target which gives you a better chance of a higher rank on search engines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-history-enthusiasts-guide-to-inspiring-youtube-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] History Enthusiasts' Guide to Inspiring YouTube Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ient-tricks-to-scramble-youtube-playlists-pcphonetv-for-2024/"><u>Efficient Tricks to Scramble YouTube Playlists (PC/Phone/TV) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-tailoring-titles-and-tags-for-top-youtube-performance-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Tailoring Titles and Tags for Top YouTube Performance for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-essential-knowledge-for-youtubes-minute-melodies-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Knowledge for YouTube's Minute Melodies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-downloader-essentials-the-best-tools-for-offline-viewing/"><u>2024 Approved  Downloader Essentials  The Best Tools For Offline Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-mobile-sound-shakers-the-ultimate-playlist/"><u>In 2024, Mobile Sound Shakers  The Ultimate Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ating-nerves-in-10-must-do-vlogs/"><u>Navigating Nerves in 10 Must-Do Vlogs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-top-7-gratis-youtube-tags-extractor-tools/"><u>In 2024, Top 7 Gratis Youtube Tags Extractor Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/mmersive-escapades-in-vr-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Top Immersive Escapades in VR on Youtube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-easy-and-fast-convert-youtube-music-into-mp3-mac-version/"><u>In 2024, Easy & Fast  Convert YouTube Music Into MP3, Mac Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-jumpstart-your-fitness-journey-essential-exercise-tunes/"><u>[New] Jumpstart Your Fitness Journey  Essential Exercise Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-it-honor-magic-6-pro-wont-turn-on-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix It Honor Magic 6 Pro Wont Turn On | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-premium-top-11-list-best-audio-tech-showcase-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Premium Top 11 List - Best Audio Tech Showcase for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-harmony-choosing-the-right-audio-mixer-for-podcasts/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Harmony  Choosing the Right Audio Mixer for Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-google-pixel-7a-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Google Pixel 7a to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-old-facebook-features-step-by-step/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering the Art of Old Facebook Features  Step-by-Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-navigating-through-challenges-with-non-functional-fb-video-share-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating Through Challenges with Non-Functional FB Video Share for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-create-discord-logo-gif/"><u>New 2024 Approved How to Create Discord Logo GIF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/game-on-in-reality-the-ultimate-vr-headset-comparison-for-2024/"><u>Game On in Reality  The Ultimate VR Headset Comparison for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-deciphering-revenue-sharing-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] Deciphering Revenue Sharing in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay! How do you feel?</p><p>I bet you are bursting and ready to create your next video. Onwards! Remember, whatever idea you pick, be sure to give it your own flair. That is what YouTube is all about.

At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.</p><p>That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:</p><h2 id="Best-Shorts-Video-Editing-Apps-for-iOS-and-Android-Free-and-Paid"><a href="#Best-Shorts-Video-Editing-Apps-for-iOS-and-Android-Free-and-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Best Shorts Video Editing Apps for iOS and Android (Free and Paid)"></a>Best Shorts Video Editing Apps for iOS and Android (Free and Paid)</h2><p>Top 10 short video editing apps for smartphones, along with their attributes, include:</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can write a short explanation text for Line 1 or tell the audiences what to do next such as download the software or sub to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Add-helpful-text-to-the-description"><a href="#2-Add-helpful-text-to-the-description" class="headerlink" title="2.Add helpful text to the description"></a>2.Add helpful text to the description</h4><p> It is highly recommended to add additional relevant content to the video description to help audience to get to know you better. You can add a brief summary of the video content or the transcript of the video here. Normally, you can add anything that is worth mentioning such as the equipment or software that you are using to make the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-unlocking-the-secrets-to-effective-youtube-video-uploads/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Secrets to Effective YouTube Video Uploads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-youtubes-economic-model-month-to-month-income/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  YouTube's Economic Model  Month-to-Month Income?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/0-best-iphone-and-android-apps-to-make-into-videos/"><u>The 10 Best iPhone & Android Apps to Make Into Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-earnings-escalation-via-youtube-channel-initiatives/"><u>In 2024, Earnings Escalation via YouTube Channel Initiatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/amers-guide-to-video-recording/"><u>[New] Gamer's Guide to Video Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-5-leading-3d-video-entrance-design-tools/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  5 Leading 3D Video Entrance Design Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ost-crucial-info-for-new-youtube-tv-users/"><u>The Most Crucial Info for New YouTube TV Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-first-steps-in-filmmaking-essentials-for-new-youtube-talents/"><u>[Updated] First Steps in Filmmaking  Essentials for New YouTube Talents</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-unleash-the-power-of-digital-advertising-with-our-comprehensive-set-of-50-free-youtube-banners/"><u>2024 Approved  Unleash the Power of Digital Advertising with Our Comprehensive Set of 50 FREE YouTube Banners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-mts-video-editing-top-5-software/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to MTS Video Editing Top 5 Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/undelete-lost-contacts-from-magic-v2-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>Undelete lost contacts from Magic V2.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-understanding-instagrams-tunes-and-their-legal-boundaries/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Understanding Instagram’s Tunes and Their Legal Boundaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-popularity-the-best-hashtags-to-use-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Popularity  The Best #Hashtags to Use on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audio-overhaul-methods-for-content-creators-online/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Audio Overhaul Methods for Content Creators Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/in-2024-make-this-valentines-day-unforgettable-tips-for-creating-a-personalized-video-gift/"><u>In 2024, Make This Valentines Day Unforgettable Tips for Creating a Personalized Video Gift</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-tips-to-download-and-enjoy-tiktok-on-macbook/"><u>In 2024, Essential Tips to Download and Enjoy TikTok on MacBook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-offering-the-best-understanding-of-performing-imovie-slow-motion-video/"><u>New Offering The Best Understanding of Performing iMovie Slow Motion Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/boost-your-snaps-techniques-for-enhanced-snapchat-zoom/"><u>Boost Your Snaps  Techniques for Enhanced Snapchat Zoom</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, there are certain regulations and norms by the tech giant - Google that you need to comply with in order to get your wallet stuffed.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain some of the practical methods to earn money from Google and YouTube and how YouTube Shorts contributes to the process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)"></a>How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)</h2><p>The good news is, you are not solely dependent on YouTube Shorts to generate funds from the Internet. In fact, there are several other means that can help you with that. Some of the practical ways that YouTube and Google allow you to earn through include:</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube Shorts Fund is a $100 million fund that is to be distributed from 2021 to 2022. It was introduced in May 2021 as the first step for YouTube Shorts monetization. YouTube Shorts creators that meet the requirements of the fund will receive the bonus.</p><p>To be eligible for the YouTube Shorts Fund bouns, you will need to meet the below requirements.</p><ul><li>Publish one eligible Short in the last 180 days.</li><li>Your channel does not conflict with the YouTube Community Guidelines, copyright rules, or monetization policies.</li><li>Content needs to be original and unique on the YouTube Shorts platform. Uploading movie clips or re-uploading videos from other video platforms are not allowed.</li><li>The creator must be 13 or older.</li><li><strong>Revenue by Advertisement</strong></li></ul><p>With this method, you can have advertisements displayed on your regular YouTube videos. These advertisements help the streaming media generate funds, some part of which is then shared with you. In a broader spectrum, the more videos your YouTube channel has the more money you make.</p><ul><li><strong>Channel Membership</strong></li></ul><p>If you prepare engaging videos that are liked by the majority of users, you can set up your channel for paid members who may get attractive perks in return.</p><ul><li><strong>Merch Shelf</strong></li></ul><p>In this method, you can sell your (or others) branded products to potential customers for monetary gains.</p><ul><li><strong>Influencer</strong></li></ul><p>If you are good at speaking and can motivate people, becoming an influencer is another method you can make a decent amount of money from YouTube with. When you become an influencer, you can get associated with multiple organizations and companies to promote their products and services and get paid.</p><ul><li><strong>Super Chat and Super Stickers</strong></li></ul><p>If you have a good fan base, you can highlight their messages and chat and can charge them for this.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Premium</strong></li></ul><p>You can prepare some engaging and informative videos that are exclusively available for the YouTube Premium members. Because these subscribers have purchased YouTube Premium membership, the streaming platform shares the profit it gets from such users with you.</p><p>The approaches discussed above can help you earn money with YouTube. Now that YouTube has rolled out the plan for YouTube Shorts monetization, we can anticipate more YouTube Shorts monetization in the future. You can also publish your YouTube Shorts video on your channel and the Shorts Shelf. YouTube then suggests these clips to others with similar interests (depending on the keywords that you have added in the description). When such users watch your short videos, the chances are that they would subscribe to your YouTube channel and watch the regular videos that you have already posted, thus helping you make money using any of the methods listed above.</p><p>Another positive aspect of this approach is, the number of views your short videos affects the overall analytics of your YouTube channel (in terms of view count and playback duration), and therefore play a vital role in meeting the minimum requirements as per YouTube policies to get your other, regular YouTube clips monetized.</p><h2 id="Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?"></a>Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?</h2><p>When you start publishing short videos on your YouTube channel, the views that those clips get also affect the total view count and the playback duration of your channel. Although this helps you reach the minimum threshold for the monetization services that the platform offers, because the short videos cannot be monetized, you may see some depreciation in the revenue generation over time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Because YouTube Shorts is still in the Beta phase at the time of this writing, the short videos don’t directly contribute to the monetization process. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, every time your short clips are viewed, your channel’s analytics are affected as per the view count and the playback time.</p><p>Furthermore, with interesting short videos, your channel is likely to get more subscribers, thus resulting in meeting the minimum threshold to becoming eligible and applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program.</p><p>Regardless of the fact that the revenue may seem deteriorated in contrast with the number of views and play time of the videos, the increment in the number of subscribers and paid members (if your channel allows them) would significantly appreciate your income.</p><p>And the most optimistic part is, Google is still working on and exploring YouTube Shorts. With that, the chances are, even the short videos could be monetized in the future.</p><p>The bottom line is, no matter what the current scenario of YouTube Shorts is, you must ensure to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create engaging videos for YouTube Shorts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using any of the tools like Wondershare Filmora in order to attract more subscribers to increase your earnings.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-youtube-earnings-update-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>In 2024, YouTube Earnings Update - What You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-uncovering-10-premier-youtube-sources-for-history-buffs/"><u>In 2024, Uncovering 10 Premier YouTube Sources for History Buffs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ction-packed-shoots-creating-dynamic-video-stories-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Action-Packed Shoots  Creating Dynamic Video Stories on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-10-second-teasers-explained/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  10-Second Teasers Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-essential-guide-to-free-licensed-audio-for-yt/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Essential Guide to Free, Licensed Audio for YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/rofessional-thumbnail-tactics-dos-and-donts-guidebook-for-2024/"><u>[New] Professional Thumbnail Tactics  Do's and Don'ts Guidebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/53499823-new-2024-approved-youtube-subscriber-awards-the-play-button-awards-for-creators/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  YouTube Subscriber Awards!

It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.</p><p>A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link"></a>How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link</h2><p>YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following to the end of your channel URL:</p><p>?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.</p><p>This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>That’s a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor’s YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub%5C_confirmation=1" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features lots of video and audio editing tools that enables you to cut, trim and touch up the video clip easily.

Plus, it is an easy way to disguise the room you are vlogging from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-blur01.JPG"                      alt="how to blur01"                ></p><p>Even if your set is clean, there could be things like books behind you, which will distract viewers; they will be trying to read the spines. Blurring out the background of your shot makes your video look polished and keeps people’s focus entirely on you.</p><ul><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_shooting">Part 1: Blur YouTube Video Background in Shooting Videos</a></li><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_editing">Part 2: Add Tilt-Shift Effects to Video in Editing</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos</h2><p>Blurring your background is also how you create a beautiful bokeh lighting effect. Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor</h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora"><a href="#1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can find them easily by typing bokeh in the search bar in Effects.</p><p>Note: you should select <strong>Included</strong> to see all bokeh effects pre-programmed in Filmora. If you need more visual effects, just go to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Filmstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> effects store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-bokeh-effect.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Bokeh effect"                ></p><p>Double click the bokeh effect to preview the result, and if you find the bokeh effect fits the video, just drop it to the track above the video. And the bokeh filter or overlay will be applied to the video automatically.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Tilt-Shift-Circle-Linear-Effect-to-Blur-Video-Background"><a href="#2-Use-Tilt-Shift-Circle-Linear-Effect-to-Blur-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="2.

Keep It Under 10 Seconds</strong></p><p>A 10-second intro should have lots of movement and exciting music to hold viewers’ attention. If your intro is more subdued then aim for more than 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>2. Support Your Brand</strong></p><p>One of the most important things your intro can do is strengthen your personal brand. Your intro should look related to your channel art and video thumbnails, but even beyond that, it should match the tone of your content.</p><p><strong>3. Use Music</strong></p><p>When there’s a silent pause in your video the chances of viewers clicking away increase. Make sure your intro includes music that suits the tone of your channel.</p><p><strong>4. Include Your Channel Name</strong></p><p>Your channel name should be a huge, prominent, visual in your intro. This may seem like a given, but there are intros out there where the channel name is either small easy to overlook, or left out completely in favor of a logo.</p><p><strong>5. Do a Cold Open</strong></p><p>On TV, shows usually have at least one scene before they play the theme song. That’s because nobody is tuning in just for the theme, or in your case the intro. Make sure you have at least a short clip before your intro to get viewers interested in the rest of your video. Beyond setting the tone for the rest of the video and introducing your topic, you can use this first clip to create a ‘curiosity gap’.

It’s easy to carry around, and the ability to simply connect to a smartphone means you can set up and shoot your video on the fly.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: This mic, although it has a great range, can also pick up subtle movements you make as it is clipped onto you. Not great if there is a lot of action in your videos.</p><h4 id="TONOR-PC-Microphone-Computer-Condenser-15-99"><a href="#TONOR-PC-Microphone-Computer-Condenser-15-99" class="headerlink" title="TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99"></a><strong>TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TONOR-Microphone-Condenser-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B01142EPO4/" >TONOR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is an easy-to-setup condenser microphone that you can connect to your computer via USB and start recording in seconds.</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser.jpg"                      alt="tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser"                ></strong></p><p> <strong>Pro:</strong> The value of this microphone is in its ease of use. With a flexible, foldable stand, you can adjust the TONOR PC microphone the way it suits your setup. The legs of the stand are retractable, which makes it easy for you to store. If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it won’t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isn’t a wide range. It’s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $50"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $50</strong></h2><h4 id="Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99"><a href="#Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99" class="headerlink" title="Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99"></a><strong>Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras.

It doesn’t require any battery and is powered by whatever device it is plugged into, which is great for YouTubers with already so many devices to keep charged.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Much like the BOYA BY-M1, the Purple Panda, as it is clipped onto your lapel or shirt collar, will capture the sound of your clothes brushing against it if too much movement occurs.</p><h4 id="Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73"><a href="#Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73" class="headerlink" title="Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73"></a><strong>Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42" >Samson Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> microphone is the kind of mic that can fit in your pocket and be taken with you anywhere.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone.jpg"                      alt="samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has both a cardioid and an omnidirectional mode. This means that you can choose to have your microphone focused more on the subject speaking by switching to cardio or switch to Omni-directional to capture audio from the entire surrounding.</p><p>It is designed to be able to clip onto a flat surface such as your computer screen. This allows you to place the microphone on different levels to record.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Because of its unique design and the portability of the device, it will suffer wear-and-tear faster. Attention to storage is necessary to increase the lifespan of the device.</p><h4 id="XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99"><a href="#XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99" class="headerlink" title="XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99"></a><strong>XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99</strong></h4><p>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Condenser-Microphone-Recording-XIAOKOA/dp/B074GZJ4RP/" >XIAOKOA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>portable mini condenser microphone is compatible with smartphones, computers, and any devices using 3.5mm recording jacks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand.jpg"                      alt="xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> With a cardioid pickup, this condenser microphone will do a fine job picking up vocals. If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video. This feature can be problematic, as it could spoil your recording.</p><h4 id="TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93"><a href="#TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93" class="headerlink" title="TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93"></a><strong>TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a condenser microphone, and it can be fixed onto your camera, which simplifies your YouTube setup. This camera can plug directly into your camera, reducing the audio tracks you need to manage when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/takstar-sgc-598.jpg"                      alt="takstar-sgc-598"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The camera-mounted microphone has a shock-resistant design that reduces noise when the camera is moved. The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so you’ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.</p><p>Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.</p><p>The design requires it to be mounted to the camera. If you want to separate it from the camera and still have it recorded, a bit of creativity is required to keep it standing.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $100"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $100</strong></h2><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="Behringer-C-1U-59-99"><a href="#Behringer-C-1U-59-99" class="headerlink" title="Behringer C-1U - $59.99"></a><strong>Behringer C-1U - $59.99</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1U-BEHRINGER/dp/B001QXCYZY/" >Behringer C-1U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/behringer-c-1u.jpg"                      alt="behringer-c-1u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has a solid metal build and has a good weight. It is quick and easy to set up and is a good microphone for anyone wanting a simple solution for better audio on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> A pop filter is recommended for this microphone as it picks up a lot of popping sounds when the subject speaks.</p><h4 id="Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-64-94"><a href="#Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-64-94" class="headerlink" title="Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94"></a><strong>Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Versatile-Microphone/dp/B01L5U4WBQ" >Blue Microphones Snowball iCE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a cardioid condenser microphone that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/blue-microphones-snowball-ice.jpg"                      alt="blue-microphones-snowball-ice"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The Snowball iCE is a plug-and-play microphone that is super easy to use and doesn’t require any additional battery. Simply connect it to the computer, and you are ready to record your voice. It captures clear and crisp audio for a single voice or single-person recording.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The range of this microphone is not that great; you’ll have to be close and be speaking directly into the microphone to get the best audio. It is not ideal for recording moving subjects or those who are further than 2-3 feet away.</p><h4 id="Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-57-06"><a href="#Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-57-06" class="headerlink" title="Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06"></a><strong>Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a condenser microphone that records in a cardioid polar pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/marantz-professional-mpm-1000u.jpg"                      alt="marantz-professional-mpm-1000u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro</strong>: This budget microphone has excellent all-metal construction. It has a plug-and-play setup and doesn’t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.</p><p>If your YouTube videos consist of you in a quiet studio environment, I would recommend the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>However, if you will be recording on the go and require your hands to be free in the scene, I recommend getting a lavalier microphone such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But, if you are going to be recording other people, in addition to yourself, I’d say go with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it will give you more audio control in busy environments.</p><p>What are you looking for in a budget microphone?
