To do so, it’s essential to provide something unique and different to the viewer. Without providing them the content they are looking for, it is impossible to grow your channel and reach. Once your content is ready and you are getting many views, it is essential to make these potential viewers your permanent viewers. The animated subscribe button will help you achieve this goal. While your viewers are watching your videos, you must remind them about subscribing to your channel for receiving such incredible content in the future. Subscribe animation plays a vital role in converting your viewers into subscribers.</p><p>There are so many platforms on the internet from where you can get Youtube subscribe button animation free, and you can also purchase these subscribe png gifs. But creating your own animated subscribe button can make you stand out from the crowd and make your videos unique and exclusive. Because it enables you to design it the way you want according to your brand, so, let’s create your own subscribe animation using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><hr><h2 id="Step-By-Step-guide"><a href="#Step-By-Step-guide" class="headerlink" title="Step-By-Step guide"></a>Step-By-Step guide</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started,open Filmora X. On your upper left corner, click on the “Sample Colors,” select the Green color and drag it to Video Track into the timeline. We are using a Green background to easily remove it using the green screen feature in Filmora to use it in our future projects after exporting it, without creating it again. Adjust the duration of this track according to your requirement. In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png"                      alt="subscribe-button1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png"                      alt="subscribe-button2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now it’s time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png"                      alt="subscribe-button3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png"                      alt="subscribe-button4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, let’s add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. “Basic 6” will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png"                      alt="subscribe-button5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with “Subscribe” and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png"                      alt="subscribe-button6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png"                      alt="subscribe-button7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png"                      alt="subscribe-button8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Now, it’s time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let’s animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the ‘Animation’ tab and then click ‘Customize.’ Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click ‘Add.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png"                      alt="subscribe-button9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png"                      alt="subscribe-button10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click ‘ADVANCED.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png"                      alt="subscribe-button11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> In this Advance text editor, go to the ‘Animation’ tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png"                      alt="subscribe-button12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking ‘Add’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png"                      alt="subscribe-button13"                ></p><p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png"                      alt="subscribe-button14"                ></p><p><strong>Step 15:</strong> To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png"                      alt="subscribe-button15"                ></p><p><strong>Step 16:</strong> You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora. Now place it into the timeline where it can match the movement of the cursor.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button16.png"                      alt="subscribe-button16"                ></p><p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now it’s time to make this subscribe animation button disappear. Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png"                      alt="subscribe-button17"                ></p><p><strong>Step 18:</strong> After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0. It will make it disappear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button18.png"                      alt="subscribe-button18"                ></p><p><strong>Step 19:</strong> Do the same with the cursor. Double click on the cursor in the time and add a key frame at its actual position.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button19.png"                      alt="subscribe-button19"                ></p><p><strong>Step 20:</strong> Move ahead when you want it to disappear. Move the cursor out of the screen and click ‘OK’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button20.png"                      alt="subscribe-button20"                ></p><p><strong>Step 21:</strong> Your Subscribe png gif is ready to be exported and used in your videos. Click on export and choose from various formats and options to choose from while exporting it.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button21.png"                      alt="subscribe-button21"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>How to Get People to Subscribe Channel</strong></a></p><p>Conclusion：Your own Animated Subscribe Button is ready to be used in your future videos and projects.

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward. The host will get a notification on his or her registered email-id when a viewer publishes a comment on their posted video. You will find the link to the highlighted comment in the notification</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Replying to “highlighted comments” on your YouTube channel is pretty easy since this feature was developed, keeping the user’s convenience in mind. If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing.

The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139122/17108" target="_top" id="2139122">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139122" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139122/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial.

Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.</p><p>When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.</p><p>Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.</p><p>Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project"></a>Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project</h2><h3 id="Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship"><a href="#Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: build affiliate relationship"></a>Step 1: build affiliate relationship</h3><p>One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.</p><p>Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.</p><p>If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-relationship.JPG"                      alt="affiliate relationship YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136625/26400" target="_top" id="2136625">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136625" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136625/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Create-your-product-video"><a href="#Step-2-Create-your-product-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create your product video"></a>Step 2: Create your product video</h3><p>The next step is to actually produce your video.

One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.</p><p>It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Know-your-product-well"><a href="#3-Know-your-product-well" class="headerlink" title="3.

YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.</p><p>You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/know-product.JPG"                      alt="know product"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are various great reasons for getting involved in YouTube affiliate marketing.

But if you don’t keep on top of it, your Watch Later list can quickly become unmanageable and cluttered with content that you no longer want to watch afterward.</p><p>If you are wondering how, you can declutter the playlist, we’ve got you covered. To help you with the task, we’ve compiled a comprehensive step-by-step guide. In this article, we will show you how to clear Watch Later on YouTube with just a few clicks.</p><p>So, without beating around the bush, let’s get started with our tutorial!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist</h2><p>If your YouTube Watch Later playlist is filled with videos you’ll never watch again, or you are not interested in that specific content type, you can quickly delete these videos at any time.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step process on <strong>how to clear Watch Later on YouTube Web and App:</strong></p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?</h3><p>You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:</p><h5 id="From-YouTube-Homepage"><a href="#From-YouTube-Homepage" class="headerlink" title="From YouTube Homepage"></a>From YouTube Homepage</h5><p>To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin"><strong>YouTube homepage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Sign into your account if needed and click the <strong>“Library”</strong> option located at the left-hand side menu panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png"                      alt="accessing the youtube web library"                ></p><p>Step2 Croll down and click the <strong>“See All”</strong> option under the Watch Later header. Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.</p><p>Step3 From the drop-down menu, click <strong>“Remove Watch Videos.”</strong> This will instantly remove all the videos you’ve watched but are still in the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/removing-watched-videos-from-youtube-watch-later.png"                      alt="removing watched videos from youtube watch later"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the <strong>Three Dots</strong>. Select the <strong>“Remove from Watch Later”</strong> option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="clearing the youtube watch later playlist"                ></p><h5 id="Using-A-Script"><a href="#Using-A-Script" class="headerlink" title="Using A Script"></a>Using A Script</h5><p>Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> browser on your system and head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website**.** Next, select the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the left pane and click <strong>“Watch Later”</strong> from the menu.</p><p>Step2 Now, hit the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + J”</strong> keys on Windows or the <strong>“Command + Option+ J”</strong> buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png"                      alt="using script to clear watch later"                ></p><p>Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.</p><p>setInterval(function () { document.querySelector(‘#primary button[aria-label&#x3D;”Action menu”]‘).click(); var things &#x3D; document.evaluate( ‘&#x2F;&#x2F;span[contains(text(),”Remove from”)]‘, document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null ); for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);</p><p>Step4 In the last step, hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some. The script above has been confirmed to work, but others still need to be thoroughly checked and could potentially damage your computer. To prevent this from happening, only look for scripts from reliable sources instead of those posted by random people in various forums.</p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?</h3><p>If you are using YouTube on an Android or iOS device, it is possible to clear the Watch Later Playlist by doing the steps below:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, <strong>swipe up</strong> on the Homescreen of your Android device or <strong>swipe right</strong> on your iOS device to launch App Drawer, and tap “<strong>YouTube”</strong> to launch the app.</p><p>Step2 Now, tap the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the bottom-right corner of the screen and tap <strong>“Watch Later.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing the watch later playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, tap the three dots (vertical ellipses) icon on the top-right side of the screen and choose the <strong>“Remove Watched Videos”</strong> option to delete them from the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-watch-later-on-youtube-app.png"                      alt="clearing watch later on youtube app"                ></p><p>Step4 If there are still unwatched videos in the playlist, select a video and tap the three dots next to it.

In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.</p><h4 id="Video-Title"><a href="#Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="Video Title"></a>Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking"                ></p><p>YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.</p><p>On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.</p><p>Video titles should have five words or less. Don’t forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.</p><h4 id="Video-Description"><a href="#Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="Video Description"></a>Video Description</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description"                ></p><p>When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.</p><p>When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.</p><h4 id="Video-Quality"><a href="#Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h4><p>Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time"><a href="#Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails"><a href="#Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views"><a href="#Number-of-Views" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging.

Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time-3"><a href="#Watch-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails-3"><a href="#Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views-3"><a href="#Number-of-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902273/19272" target="_top" id="1902273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902273/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect.

Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video-3"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings.

They’re convenient and they draw the least amount of attention. But since most smartphones weren’t made specifically for vlogging, there’s a lot of room to make them more suitable for that purpose.

If you’re planning to vlog all throughout your day with your phone, you need a portable way to charge it back up. RAVPower has a great line up of portable chargers with multiple USB inputs that hold a total charge of more than 20,000 mAh. With that amount, you can fully charge your smartphone more than 6 times! I own one myself and it’s been great for me during my travels. A 22,000 mAh charger goes for about $42 USD.</p><h3 id="2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount"><a href="#2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount" class="headerlink" title="2. Arkon Tripod Mount"></a>2.

Not only does it have bendable legs, like the more expensive Joby GorillaPod tripod, that you can wrap around all kinds of structures, but it also comes with the smartphone mount, which Joby sells separately. Another great thing about the Arkon tripod is that its smartphone mount can be rotated so that you can position your phone to film in either widescreen or portrait mode.</p><h3 id="3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case"><a href="#3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case" class="headerlink" title="3.

These cases can stick to glass, mirrors, metal, and more. They range from $20 to $30 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1743243">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1743243.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1743243">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1743243.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Faligracehair.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1743243%2F19272'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1743243/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light"><a href="#4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light" class="headerlink" title="4.

In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera.

This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone. So you wouldn’t want to use this for livestreaming.</p><h3 id="6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set"><a href="#6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set" class="headerlink" title="6.

The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories. Sound and lighting equipment made for stand-alone cameras perform much better too. Many of these accessories are meant to connect to the camera “shoe” (a bracket on top of the camera that accessories can be attached to). Smartphones don’t come with these kinds of shoes. So, to take advantage of these higher quality accessories, you’ll need some kind of camera rig for your smartphone that also comes with shoes. The iOgrapher Go offers this at around $60 USD. This accessory comes with three shoes.</p><h3 id="8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System"><a href="#8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System" class="headerlink" title="8. Manfrotto TwistGrip System"></a>8.

This system also comes with three shoes. An advantage the TwistGrip System has over the iOgrapher Go is that it is much more portable. Its three connected parts can be detached to take up less space in your bag.

This gimbal is very effective in helping you record smooth video. Using the app that it comes with, you can even preset this gimbal to smoothly pan and rotate from a starting position to an ending position, giving you the opportunity to film beautiful time lapses. You can get this device at around $100 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134218/18498" target="_top" id="2134218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134218/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software in YouTube video editing, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides lots of templates and effects with an intuitive interface, which saves much time.

For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.</p><p>My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Become YouTube Partner should be easier"                ></p><p><em>I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those.</em></p><p>However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.</p><h4 id="1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number"><a href="#1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number" class="headerlink" title="1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number"></a>1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number</h4><p>This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.</p><p>Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).</p><p>If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.</p><h4 id="2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money"><a href="#2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money" class="headerlink" title="2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money"></a>2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg"                      alt=" the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube"                ></p><p><em>Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight.</em></p><p>How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.</p><p>You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.</p><p>It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.</p><h4 id="3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized"><a href="#3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized" class="headerlink" title="3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized"></a>3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized</h4><p>YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.</p><p>Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process. Channels with content that violates YouTube’s Community Guidelines can be barred from monetization.</p><h4 id="4-Thieves-won’t-profit"><a href="#4-Thieves-won’t-profit" class="headerlink" title="4. Thieves won’t profit"></a>4. Thieves won’t profit</h4><p>There are people out there who want views, subscribers, and nice comments but who do not want to put any real work into getting them. It isn’t uncommon for someone like this to download a video they like and post it to their own channel.</p><p>This reposted video will steal views and ad revenue away from the real post on the creator’s channel.</p><p>Having a review process for the Partnership Program will help ensure that these content thieves are caught before they can make any money.</p><p>YouTube also recently made it easier to report users for impersonation, regardless of how many views they have.</p><p><em>TheGamingGuy looked into people who had stolen his logo and found out they had also stolen whole videos from other YouTubers.</em></p><p>There are clear benefits to this new milestone, but there are also some questions remaining.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-does-this-change-stop-content-thieves-from-taking-views-and-ad-revenue-from-creators"><a href="#How-does-this-change-stop-content-thieves-from-taking-views-and-ad-revenue-from-creators" class="headerlink" title="How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?"></a>How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?</h2><p>It will help stop them from making money themselves, but not from siphoning away views from other channels. The impersonation rules only apply if somebody is pretending to be another creator. You can steal and repost someone’s content without pretending to be them.</p><p>This new rule does take away money as an incentive for stealing content, but a lot of people doing this probably aren’t in it for the money. They might just be misguided fans who want to repost videos they enjoy.</p><h2 id="Could-this-affect-your-CPM"><a href="#Could-this-affect-your-CPM" class="headerlink" title="Could this affect your CPM?"></a>Could this affect your CPM?</h2><p>Competition plays a huge role in how much YouTubers earn from ad revenue. Some genres are bigger on YouTube than others and, the more popular your genre is, the more options advertisers have. The more competition there is for higher-paying ads, the larger your channel has to be to get them.</p><p>Could this new milestone decrease competition in some genres?</p><p>Leave a comment to let me know what you think.

It was launched in February 2005 and today it is serving like one of the biggest social media network. This platform was actually designed by few creative PayPal workers.</p><p><strong>Dailymotion:</strong> It is a French social site and one popular competitor against YouTube. This site was launched by Orange on 15th March, 2005. You can watch wide range of videos on Dailymotion but for limited duration of time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion</h2><p> Here we few key terms that can help you to understand difference between YouTube and Dailymotion:</p><h4 id="1-Numbers"><a href="#1-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="1.Numbers"></a>1.Numbers</h4><p> The total number of viewers that interact with site like Dailymotion and YouTube is actually one of the important parameter for business because it decides the number of video ads and text that will be placed on site. We all know that YouTube is world’s biggest network for videos and Dailymotion follows it at second number. Statistics reveal that there are so many advantages of YouTube over Dailymotion, especially in terms of total site visitors as YouTube gets billions of visitors per month but this count is limited to 112 million visitors in case of Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="2-3D-Videos"><a href="#2-3D-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.3D Videos"></a>2.3D Videos</h4><p> 3D videos are one of the biggest needs of viewers these days so its availability on site definitely boosts site importance in market. As YouTube is developed with Beta so it is capable enough to provide impressive 3D viewing experience to viewers but on the other side, Dailymotion lacks behind in this capability. You cannot enjoy 3D content on Dailymotion screens.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Quality"><a href="#3-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Video Quality"></a>3.Video Quality</h4><p> One more important criterion for comparison between YouTube and Dailymotion is the overall allowed time limit for video uploads. In case of Dailymotion, you will often find all videos with less than 60 minute duration but on YouTube, video can be of any big length as it never poses any restriction on the basis of time duration. Here is one wonderful thing to know that on YouTube videos of worth 72 hour duration are uploaded per second. And viewers in YouTube are capable enough to watch fresh videos day and night.</p><p> Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="4-Analytics"><a href="#4-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="4.Analytics"></a>4.Analytics</h4><p> You might be aware about the fact that YouTube is owned by Behemoth Google; that is why it possesses most robust analytics tools as like YouTube insights. With these advanced tools, businesses as well as individuals can monitor their viewers on videos. They can also make analysis about how long and how often a particular visitor stays on videos. It helps businesses to improve their video content so that more visitors can be attracted. Dailymotion cannot offer you such details, here you can access just publication date of video, nothing else. The true fact is that Dailymotion itself has a YouTube channel that users often access to upload multiple videos so that Dailymotion can avail some promotions.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos"></a>Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos</h2><p> If you often watch, download or upload videos on YouTube and Dailymotion platform then you may also need to edit them time to time. In order to fulfil this need you may need editing software. Professionals recommend Wondershare Filmora as one of the best and easiest editing tool with wide range of features. It can process more than 150 video file formats so you can easily edit whatever you want to customize.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-digital-broadcast-face-off-facebook-vs-youtube-and-tweetstreams/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Digital Broadcast Face-Off FACEbook Vs.

Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files.

This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram.

The best way to grow your channel is to focus on putting out quality content consistently. We do not recommend the following methods, but they do exist. Here are a couple of alternatives to purchasing views which are along those same lines (if you want to know how to grow organically without resorting to tactics like these, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) When YouTube first started, getting views and subscribers was a lot easier. That’s not to say that creator didn’t have to work hard on their channels, just that they had a lot less competition.</p><p>YouTube has become so popular now that it is not uncommon for creators to look for alternative ways to stand out. Some might choose to buy views to kick start the organic growth of their channels (which is not a good idea), while others are looking for free ways of getting those views.</p><p>Two of these alternative methods are:</p><p><a href="#exchange"><strong>Part 1: Get More Views with View Exchange Platforms</strong></a></p><p><a href="#bots"><strong>Part 2: Get More YouTube Views with Bots</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-free-youtube-subs-banner.jpg"                      alt="Get free YouTube Subs"                ></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-View-Exchange-Platforms"><a href="#1-View-Exchange-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="#1: View Exchange Platforms"></a>#1: View Exchange Platforms</h2><p>There are a variety of websites to choose from, but the main purpose is the same: you watch other people’s videos in order for them to watch your videos.</p><p>Here are the most popular view exchange platforms:</p><h4 id="1-View2be"><a href="#1-View2be" class="headerlink" title="1.

After you sign up, you will need to start watching videos from other YouTube publishers who are also members at View2be in order to earn coins. One of the differences between View2be and other view exchange platforms is that here, you can also complete some other tasks such as liking videos in order to earn more coins.</p><p>You can then spend the coins on views and likes for your own videos.</p><h4 id="2-GrowViews"><a href="#2-GrowViews" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is how the platform lists your YouTube videos.</p><p>After signing in, you just need to click on the Play button. The site’s player will work on the background, playing videos from other YouTube creators.</p><p>For each video that you watch, you will get 1 credit that you can then exchange for views on your own videos.</p><h4 id="3-YTMonster"><a href="#3-YTMonster" class="headerlink" title="3.

This platform isn’t only for YouTube views, it is for the exchange of social actions across multiple websites. One of the main advantages of using the KingdomLikes is that you can also use this same platform to get likes or views on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as well as on YouTube.</p><p>Just like with the other platforms, you will need to watch other people’s videos in order to earn views for yourself.</p><h4 id="5-AddVisits"><a href="#5-AddVisits" class="headerlink" title="5.

Once your video is approved, you define how many points you are willing to give to people who watch your videos or like them. In exchange, you watch other people’s videos and get points as compensation. You can then exchange those points for more views or likes.</p><h2 id="2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots"><a href="#2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots" class="headerlink" title="#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots"></a>#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots</h2><p>When most people think about getting free views on YouTube, they immediately think about bots.</p><p>Bots can be dangerous for your channel. The wrong bot can really hurt your search rankings and if you get caught using bots you can lose your account.</p><p>If you are going to try a bot, make sure you choose one that offers high retention views (most can’t, but may say they can). High retention views mean YouTube interprets the data as someone watching your video for a period of time, vs just clicking on it and then leaving the page. A bot that can’t offer high retention views just ends up making it look like a lot of people clicked on your video, but none of them liked it enough to watch. That will cause YouTube to rank your video very low in its search results.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-better-youtube-videos--278.html" >Making great content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and polishing up your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >YouTube SEO skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you grow your channel over time, and this is probably the best way to go. However, you have a lot of options for how to get free views on YouTube if you want to try to kick start that growth.

Of the major developments made in the recent past is the introduction of Shorts. These short vertical videos have grown in popularity as more people view videos on their phones.

YouTube Shorts Fund: Introduction and Benefits</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched YouTube Shorts Funds in 2021 to financially support creators who produce engaging and popular Shorts content. The monetization scheme would distribute $100 million to high-performing creators on the platform. The creators would receive high engagement and views from their Shorts for funding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-1.jpeg"                      alt="youtube shorts fund"                ></p><p>The main objective of the YouTube Shorts fund is to encourage creativity, diversity, and innovation in Shorts content creation. The fund operated between 2021 and 2022. It lets creators earn $100 - $10,000 a month for their content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-2.jpeg"                      alt="youtube shorts fund earnings"                ></p><p>Participating in YouTube Shorts Funds offer several benefits to the creators:</p><ul><li><strong>Additional Exposure:</strong> YouTube Shorts are predominately featured on the homepage, allowing creators to reach more people.</li><li><strong>Recognition:</strong> YouTube recognizes top Shorts creators through the Shorts Funding program, encouraging them to create more quality content.</li><li><strong>Potential Earnings</strong>: Creators can monetize their Shorts content in several ways including adding and other unique features.</li></ul><p>YouTube incorporated monetization of Shorts in its YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Therefore, YouTube merged the Shorts Fund with the YPP in February 2023. This led to YouTube Shorts Fund 2023 which now offers creators more opportunities to make money quickly on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Making-Money-with-YouTube-Shorts-Eligibility-and-Earnings"><a href="#Part-2-Making-Money-with-YouTube-Shorts-Eligibility-and-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The revenue-sharing model has now taken the place of the YouTube Shorts Fund, which only rewarded creators using YouTube’s money. However, creators don’t have to be members of the YPP to start receiving YouTube Shorts funding.
