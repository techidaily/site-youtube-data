It is not the best platform for every video creator, though. This article will introduce you to some YouTube alternatives.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons you might want to learn about other websites like YouTube. You might want a site with less ads, or different ways of monetizing. YouTube can sometimes remove videos unfairly, so you may want a site where copyright claims are handled by people instead of robots. A lot of users simply want a site that is more like YouTube was when it was younger. There are features, like customizable channel pages, which have been discarded over the years.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="YouTube-Alternatives-3-Best-Video-Sharing-Sites-1"><a href="#YouTube-Alternatives-3-Best-Video-Sharing-Sites-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites"></a>YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites</h2><p>Here is a list of other places where you can upload videos:</p><h4 id="1-Dailymotion"><a href="#1-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="1. Dailymotion"></a>1. Dailymotion</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG"                      alt="YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion"                ></p><p>This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.</p><p>The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.</p><h4 id="2-Vimeo"><a href="#2-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="2. Vimeo"></a>2. Vimeo</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG"                      alt="YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo"                ></p><p>Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.</p><p>There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.</p><p>If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.</p><p>Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.</p><h4 id="3-ZippCast"><a href="#3-ZippCast" class="headerlink" title="3. ZippCast"></a>3. ZippCast</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-zippcast.JPG"                      alt="YouTune Alternatives - ZippCast"                ></p><p>ZippCast is praised by some for being very similar to pre-Google YouTube. While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.</p><p>One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.</p><p>Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-simply-saver-top-mobile-apps-for-downloading-youtube-series-and-songs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Simply Saver Top Mobile Apps for Downloading YouTube Series & Songs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-swiftly-swap-songs-in-your-youtube-collection/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Swiftly Swap Songs in Your YouTube Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-join-the-social-scene-facebook-live-streams-on-roku-tv-for-2024/"><u>[New] Join The Social Scene Facebook Live Streams on Roku TV for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-shutterbugs-essential-guide-for-insta-posting-for-2024/"><u>[New] Shutterbugs' Essential Guide for Insta-Posting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-uncover-free-photo-and-video-resources-from-esteemed-4-online-sources/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Uncover Free Photo and Video Resources From Esteemed 4 Online Sources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-a-palette-of-pleasantness-five-winter-backgrounds-ideas-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Palette of Pleasantness Five Winter Backgrounds Ideas for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-androidios-video-cutting-edge-8-top-montage-tools-revealed/"><u>2024 Approved Android/iOS Video Cutting-Edge 8 Top Montage Tools Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-closing-with-panache-free-youtubes-1-six/"><u>2024 Approved Closing with Panache Free YouTube's #1 Six!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-prevent-cross-site-tracking-on-honor-magic-6-and-browser-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on Honor Magic 6 and Browser | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-superb.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-on-saving-and-accessing-g9md-educational-videos-off-the-grid/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial on Saving and Accessing G9MD Educational Videos Off the Grid</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ltimate-checklist-to-successful-video-marketing-with-tags-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Checklist to Successful Video Marketing with Tags for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p><p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p><p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p><h3 id="1-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p><p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p><p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p><p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p><p>Check the detailed guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record with OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-XSplit"><a href="#2-XSplit" class="headerlink" title="2.

Setting up a new screencasting session with XSplit is a simple and intuitive process that is not going to take much more than a few moments of your time.</p><p>All you need to do is define a workspace, then pick the preferred resolution and frame rate. The software allows you to capture screens in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and at 60 fps, but it also offers a variety of resolution and frame rate options so that you can choose the one that best fits your needs. Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.</p><h3 id="3-Filmora"><a href="#3-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3.

Customizing a YouTube Live or any other screencasting session with this video editing software is easy, and you can choose the resolution, frame rate, or even if you want to show mouse clicks in the recording.</p><p>Capturing the webcam feed and the computer’s screen simultaneously is also an option, while you can also decide whether or not you want to record audio from a microphone, computer audio, or both at the same time.</p><p>What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys. Once you are done recording the live stream you shared on YouTube, you can edit the footage you created before uploading it to your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="4-Wondershare-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-Wondershare-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is able to easily record high-quality videos at up to 120 FPS (60 FPS for Mac) and allows you to simultaneously record both your screen and webcam. This software is incredibly user friendly and makes for an easy experience for new streamers. The dual recording makes it great for gamers who are also looking to film their reactions.</p><h3 id="5-CloudApp"><a href="#5-CloudApp" class="headerlink" title="5. CloudApp"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/uses/live-screen-recorder" >CloudApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, $10 per month for an individual user</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome</p><p>Starting a new screen capturing session with the CloudApp requires you to just specify the portion of the screen you want to capture and hit the record button. Moreover, you can choose if you want to record with or without a webcam and you have the option to enable or disable the audio recording option.</p><p>However, you can only create 90-second screen recordings with the free version of the CloudApp and you cannot set resolution or frame rate of the recording.

What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.</p><p>This piece of software is user friendly, but it doesn’t have as many features as other products on the market. Having said that, it is still an excellent tool that will help you live stream gameplay easily. Although it doesn’t come with built-in video editing software, it is possible to download another program to do this for you (i.e. Filmora). Flashback Express has the ability to record through your headset or microphone as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-VLC"><a href="#9-VLC" class="headerlink" title="9.

The split feature in Filmora can cut footage into parts and then you can move it to desired position or just delete the unnecessary part. You can choose any part of the video quickly with the Quick Trim feature in preview. Besides, Filmora supports almost all popular video and photo formats, so there will be no obstacle when you want to combine footage shot with different devices. You can add photos to video or audio to video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-split.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Split Feature"                ></p><p>To combine several footages into one, just place all clips in the video track in order.

You can get by for a long time setting your camera up on a stack of books, or an upside-down laundry hamper, but not forever. While these setups are great for a beginner, an intermediate vlogger will start to find them limiting. Even if you are an amazingly creative person who can create any camera setup without a tripod there will come a point where you will decide your creative energy is better spent on your video content.</p><p> This article will explain how to use a tripod and then introduce you to four different types.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Set-a-Tripod-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Set-a-Tripod-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging"></a>Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging</h2><h4 id="1-Setting-Up-Your-Tripod"><a href="#1-Setting-Up-Your-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1. Setting Up Your Tripod"></a>1. Setting Up Your Tripod</h4><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Pull out all three legs of your tripod and make sure it is standing stably. There will be tensioners on the legs which you can release in order to adjust your height. Once your legs are extended to the height you want continue adjusting them until your tripod is level. Some tripods have a built in bubble level, but if yours does not you can use a separate bubble level or make a guestimate.</p><p> Make sure when you are setting up your tripod that you point one of its legs towards your subject. This will give you room to stand behind your camera, in-between the other two legs. If you have one leg pointed directly behind your camera then you may trip over it. Or, you may knock over and damage your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> On the top of your tripod there will be a plate with a small hole and a screw. Remove this plate using either a clip or lever, depending on your tripod. Once your plate is detached screw it into the bottom of your camera. It should be tight, but not too tight or you risk damaging your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 3 –</strong> Attach your plate, which now has your camera mounted to it, back onto your tripod.</p><p> Your tripod comes with a ‘head’. Your tripod’s head is what your camera is mounted on top of. There are several different types of tripod heads and mounts which are all useful for different things.</p><p> Ball Heads and Pan&#x2F;Tilt Heads are the two most common types of tripod heads. Ball Heads allow you to adjust your camera’s position quite a bit before you start shooting. They are not good for adding in camera movements while you are filming, however, because you need to lock them in place. Pan&#x2F;Tilt heads are great for creating camera movement. Most Pan&#x2F;Tilt heads have a handle which you can use to make a smooth panning motion.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-You-Need-a-Tripod-Benefits-of-Using-Tripod"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-You-Need-a-Tripod-Benefits-of-Using-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod"></a>Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod</h2><p> Why can’t you just hold a camera in your hand while shooting vlog entries for your YouTube channel? Honestly, you can, but the camera may shake a lot and your footage might end up being unusable. Putting a camera on a tripod reduces the probability of camera shake to the minimum and that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p> A huge amount of vlogs can be described as sit down videos, in which the host of the video sits in front of a camera and talks to the audience. Holding a camera while talking or trying to present a product to the viewers is next to impossible, so in order to avoid having to deal with a camera, you can simply put it on a tripod, find the best angle, and push the record button.</p><p> On the go videos, are recorded at exterior locations, and a lot of YouTubers choose to shoot these types of videos handheld, but this approach makes it difficult to maintain the same shot composition for long. A Monopod, Gorillapod or just a simple selfie stick can make your job much easier because they stabilize the camera. In addition, shooting smooth panning shots without a tripod is as difficult as it sounds.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-Few-Things-You’ll-Need-to-Consider-Before-You-Buy-a-Tripod"><a href="#Part-3-A-Few-Things-You’ll-Need-to-Consider-Before-You-Buy-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: A Few Things You’ll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod"></a>Part 3: A Few Things You’ll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod</h2><p> There are thousands of different tripod models you can use for vlogging, but which model you’re going to choose depends mostly on the type of vlog you want to make. If you are planning on shooting all of your videos in the studio-like conditions, then portability isn’t such an important feature, while quite the opposite is true if you intend on filming all of your footage on outdoor locations.</p><p> However, there are certain traits you have to consider when choosing a tripod you’re going to use while recording your vlog entries.</p><p><strong>Sturdiness:</strong> There is absolutely no point in spending money on a tripod that breaks easily. Although if your plan is to shoot vlogs at home or in a studio, then buying a cheaper plastic tripod isn’t such a bad option, since the clamps and joints won’t have to endure a lot of wear and tear. Consider buying a more durable tripod if you are going to be traveling a lot while working on your vlogs.</p><p><strong>The Type of Camera:</strong> A number of factors can contribute to the weight of a camera, including battery grips or lenses, so before you buy a tripod make sure that it can support the weight of the camera you want to use to record your videos.</p><p><strong>The Maximum Height:</strong> Most vloggers don’t really have to worry about how tall their tripod is, because they are not on their feet in any of the shots featured in the video. Vloggers working on DIY videos, cooking tutorials or any other type of vlog that involves movement and action should pay attention to this trait.</p><p><strong>Photo or Video Tripods:</strong> Do you want to take beautiful panning shots? If the answer is yes then you should get a video tripod that enables you to move the camera smoothly in any direction. Photo tripods are a great option for static shots that don’t involve a lot of camera movement.</p><p> <strong>Mobility:</strong> The heavier a tripod is, the more stability it can provide, but carrying a tripod that weighs over 10 pounds to shoot sports or adventure vlogs can be a tiring endeavor. Although portability is a factor, it shouldn’t prevent you from buying a high-quality tripod that will ensure your footage is perfectly smooth and stable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186864/12108" target="_top" id="1186864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186864/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Tripods"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Tripods" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods</h2><p><strong>Full-Sized Tripods:</strong> are very sturdy, and as a result can be fairly heavy. Although you can take them a lot of places they are not convenient to carry for extended periods of time. They are the most reliable way to ensure you have absolutely no camera shake.</p><p><strong>Compact Tripods:</strong> appear to be the same size as Full-Sized tripods, but they are actually much lighter. You can get the same height with a Compact Tripod as a Full-Sized tripod and it will be much easier to travel with. However, Compact Tripods are not as stable. If you are shooting for an extended period of time you may need to weigh your Compact Tripod down with sandbags to keep it steady.</p><p><strong>Gorillapods:</strong> have flexible legs which can be wrapped around posts, fences, or anything else you may want to mount your camera on. They are also lightweight enough that you can carry them around while you shoot. If you bend it right you can essentially use your Gorillapod as a heavy-duty selfie-stick for your camera.</p><p><strong>Table-Top Tripods:</strong> are very small and easy to travel with. You can leave one in your camera bag or your glove box. Table-Top Tripods are meant to be set up on top of desks or other stable surfaces and may not be ideal for heavier cameras.</p><h2 id="Part-5-The-5-Best-Tripods-For-YouTube-Vlogging"><a href="#Part-5-The-5-Best-Tripods-For-YouTube-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging"></a>Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging</h2><p> Even if you know everything there is to know about tripods, the selection process can be daunting.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.spinxo.com/youtube-names/" >SpinXO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2.

You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://namegenerators.org/username-generator/" >Username Generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it.

While the entire world is anxiously about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the football videos on YouTube are booming. In fact, the football-related searches on this platform have been soaring in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, despite the fact that some of the most popular football clubs in the world are still ignoring how powerful YouTube has become.</p><p>We have produced the infographic below which clearly shows how popular football videos are on YouTube, so let’s have a look at some of the mind-blowing facts we’ve discovered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/top-insights-into-football-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="top insights into football videos on youtube"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Football-Content-Has-Never-Been-More-Popular-on-YouTube"><a href="#Football-Content-Has-Never-Been-More-Popular-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube"></a>Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube</h2><p>The football gods, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Neymar Jr are making enormous amounts of money, in addition to having an iconic status in the mass media. Such state of affairs explains why YouTube videos with these superstars saw an 80% increase in watch time over the course of the last year.</p><p>Interestingly, the highest amount of football-related searches on the world’s largest video sharing platform are coming from the South American and European countries. For example, France’s young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.</p><p>The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn’t nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.</p><p>Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira’s Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.</p><p>Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn’t include the actual gameplay.</p><p>As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-Sports-the-Next-Big-Thing-On-YouTube"><a href="#Are-Sports-the-Next-Big-Thing-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?"></a>Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?</h2><p>At the moment, sports videos are growing faster than any other genre of videos you can find on YouTube, including entertainment or music, while the branded partnerships in this niche are growing 111% faster than all of the sports videos combined. The window of opportunity is clear for all brands that support sports activities.</p><p>Furthermore, brand ads for corporate giants such as Nike, Gatorade or Addidas attracted millions of views, which means that the leading brands in the world of sports have recognized YouTube as a marketplace they can no longer ignore. Brands that want to gain more recognition on the international market can seize this opportunity to team up with influencers on YouTube to present and broaden the reach of their products.</p><p>Besides soccer that is currently dominating the largest video sharing platform in the world, basketball, extreme sports and winter sports also provide access to huge audiences and show promising signs that they can help brands and influencers generate more revenue. Popular YouTubers should try to include more sports-related videos on their channels because it might help them attract new followers and secure a foothold in a rapidly growing market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135370/19272" target="_top" id="2135370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135370/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-focus-on-the-essentials-the-compreenas-for-removing-youtube-channels/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Focus on the Essentials The Compreenas for Removing Youtube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-nirvana-of-movement-youtubes-top-10-yoga-creators/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Nirvana of Movement – YouTube’s Top 10 Yoga Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-formula-for-fast-tracking-to-a-thousand-subscribers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Formula for Fast-Tracking to a Thousand Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vr-on-the-go-smartphones-top-10-choices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved VR on the Go Smartphones' Top 10 Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/aximizing-visibility-a-comprehensive-guide-to-yt-gaming-hashes-for-2024/"><u>[New] Maximizing Visibility A Comprehensive Guide to YT Gaming Hashes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-beginners-guide-to-video-making-mastering-10-straightforward-youtube-concepts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Beginner's Guide to Video Making Mastering 10 Straightforward YouTube Concepts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-enhance-video-production-7-best-free-sounds-for-editors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Enhance Video Production - 7 Best Free Sounds for Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-ingenious-designer-of-visual-and-auditory-delight/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Ingenious Designer of Visual & Auditory Delight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-top-earnings-achiever-in-the-streaming-world/"><u>[Updated] Top Earnings Achiever in the Streaming World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Does find my friends work on Apple iPhone 6 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/download-secure-tp-link-drivers-on-pc-without-costs/"><u>Download Secure TP Link Drivers on PC without Costs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/how-recent-online-disruptions-turned-me-back-into-an-enthusiastic-collector-of-tangible-music-and-movies/"><u>How Recent Online Disruptions Turned Me Back Into an Enthusiastic Collector of Tangible Music and Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-oppo-a56s-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Oppo A56s 5G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-freezing-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-effective-strategies-and-solutions/"><u>Troubleshooting Freezing in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War - Effective Strategies and Solutions</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This is the majority of YouTube videos, and just about every one you’ve ever watched will have been public. You’ll want this if you want lots of people to watch your video.</p><p> <strong>Unlisted</strong></p><p> Unlisted videos are ones that anybody can view so long as they have the link. The video won’t show up on search results or in “related” or “suggested” videos.</p><p> This is a great setting for sharing a video amongst small groups. You might have a rough edit you want to show a few people, or you might have a show reel that you only want certain people to see.</p><p> <strong>Private</strong></p><p> Completely private videos cannot be watched by anyone who doesn’t have permission. You grant people permission by allowing their Google accounts to access the video. Nobody else can see the video, regardless of whether they have the link.</p><p> It won’t show up on searches, as related or suggested videos, or even when imbedded in other sites. This is the best setting for a video you need to share with only very specific people, if anyone.

This is defaulted to “public”, but you can use the drop-down menu on the button to change the setting. This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-video-privacy.jpg"                      alt="upload youtube video privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p><p> To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means <strong>“public”</strong>, the chain means <strong>“unlisted”</strong>, and the lock is for <strong>“private”</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG"                      alt="youtube privacy settings"                ></p><p> To change the privacy, click the icon. You’ll be taken to the video’s info and settings page. Down below where you see the thumbnails you’ll see the selected privacy setting.

Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p><p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p><p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134227/18498" target="_top" id="2134227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134227/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p><p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p><h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p><h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content"><a href="#6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content"></a><strong>6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p><h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p><h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p><p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p><h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p><h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p><h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p><h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p><p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p><p><em>Are you thinking of starting your daily vlog?

Very few people know to add outro to YouTube videos is the best YouTube SEO technique.</p><p>In this guide, I’ll demystify what YouTube outro is and how to make outro and add it to a YouTube video. If you are not a tech expert, use intro and outro makers highlighted herein to make your videos as interactive pas possible.</p><p>To get a sneak preview of what is entailed here; this guide has been subdivided into five parts:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best 8 Intro And Outro Makers For YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How To Make And Add Outro To YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Add An Outro To A Youtube Video</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Outro</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-YouTube-Outro-Prerequisites"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube-Outro-Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites"></a>Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites</h2><p>In this part, we will learn what outros for YouTube are, the importance of land that distinguishes them from the intro. Also included are expert tips on how to make YouTube outro that attracts a hundred thousand subscribers in seven days included.</p><p>To understand what YouTube outro is and why you should add it to your videos, here is a detailed explanation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-guide.jpg"                      alt="youtube outro making guide"                ></p><h2 id="Section-1-What-is-a-Youtube-Outro"><a href="#Section-1-What-is-a-Youtube-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: What is a Youtube Outro?"></a>Section 1: What is a Youtube Outro?</h2><p>YouTube outro aka end screen is the last part of a video with a call to action statement, button or video suggestion to view other YouTube videos. In other words, it’s the last part of a video with calls to action links.</p><p>One of the most effective technical methods of optimizing YouTube videos is by adding an outro. This helps attract huge traffic, increase conversion and engage viewers.</p><p>Why spend your time adding outro? You can add Outro to YouTube videos to direct viewers to your website, other selected videos, engage viewers for longer and to persuade them to subscribe to the channel. In short, most end screens have four elements incorporated into an outro: Channel, subscribe, Video playlist and a website link.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Difference-Between-Outro-and-Intro"><a href="#Section-2-Difference-Between-Outro-and-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro"></a>Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro</h2><p>Most YouTube videos have an intro and an outro. In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical. For your videos to achieve meaningful results, it’s important to view each as distinct from the other. Equally important to know, both intros and outros have different purposes.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Differences Between YouTube Intro And Outro</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intro</td><td>Outro</td></tr><tr><td>Inserted at the begging of a video</td><td>Inserted at the end of a video</td></tr><tr><td>Used to capture audience attention</td><td>Directs the audience to the next step</td></tr><tr><td>Introduces the topic</td><td>Suggests new topics to viewers</td></tr><tr><td>Attract viewers to the video</td><td>Contains a call-action button</td></tr><tr><td>Showcases a brand, logo, business slogan or a statement mission</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Section-3-YouTube-Outro-Requirements"><a href="#Section-3-YouTube-Outro-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements"></a>Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements</h2><p>Just as their requirements for any video uploaded on YouTube, outros are no exception. For your outro to be interactive, observe the following requirements:</p><p><strong>1. Outro Resolution</strong></p><p>Outros for YouTube should have an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a resolution of 1920px X 1080px.</p><p><strong>2. Outro Element Sizes and Dimensions</strong></p><p>End screen templates comprise elements that are in different shapes and sizes. When using a YouTube outro size of 1920px X 1080px, here are the element dimensions to use:</p><ul><li>Subscribe – 294px X 294px</li><li>Channel – 294px X 294px</li><li>Website link - 294px X 294px</li><li>Video playlist – 615px X 345px</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="youtube outro screen format"                ></p><p><strong>3. Outro Length</strong></p><p>If you want to make your outro boring, make it long. So, how long should YouTube outro be? For your outros to have a high conversation rate, they should be approximately 10-20 seconds long. However, the length of your video should be the determining factor. A one-hour YouTube video can have a longer outro.</p><p>Don’t be challenged by setting the above sizes because nearly all intro and outro makers have already set dimensions for the elements.

Try to align your thoughts with those of the viewer.</p><p>Every video creator wishes for the following goals, increasing your channel subscribers, sending traffic to another site, viewing more videos and sharing to social media. Each YouTube outro element should have its own goal.</p><ol><li><strong>Simple, clear and easy to interpret</strong></li></ol><p>Your outro will be meaningless if the audience cannot take action due to the complexity of either the language used or the ambiguity of words used. Use colors that pop out the elements making them the center of focus. Make them clear and avoid anything distractive.</p><ol><li><strong>Use similar outro templates</strong></li></ol><p>Apart from being a good method of branding your channel, using similar outro on your videos adds credibility.

More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p><p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139112/17108" target="_top" id="2139112">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139112" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139112/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c. Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p><p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>! Till date, the video has over 14 million views</p><p>We do not advise you to try this out when you are just starting your YouTube career. Only venture out to such investments when you are stable when it comes to earnings.</p><h2 id="Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback"></a><strong>Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback</strong></h2><p>All your videos must be created with the audience in mind. However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience.

In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png"                      alt="subscribe-button1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png"                      alt="subscribe-button2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now it’s time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png"                      alt="subscribe-button3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png"                      alt="subscribe-button4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, let’s add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. “Basic 6” will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png"                      alt="subscribe-button5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with “Subscribe” and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png"                      alt="subscribe-button6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png"                      alt="subscribe-button7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png"                      alt="subscribe-button8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Now, it’s time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let’s animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the ‘Animation’ tab and then click ‘Customize.’ Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click ‘Add.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png"                      alt="subscribe-button9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png"                      alt="subscribe-button10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click ‘ADVANCED.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png"                      alt="subscribe-button11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> In this Advance text editor, go to the ‘Animation’ tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png"                      alt="subscribe-button12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking ‘Add’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png"                      alt="subscribe-button13"                ></p><p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png"                      alt="subscribe-button14"                ></p><p><strong>Step 15:</strong> To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png"                      alt="subscribe-button15"                ></p><p><strong>Step 16:</strong> You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora. Now place it into the timeline where it can match the movement of the cursor.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button16.png"                      alt="subscribe-button16"                ></p><p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now it’s time to make this subscribe animation button disappear. Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png"                      alt="subscribe-button17"                ></p><p><strong>Step 18:</strong> After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0. It will make it disappear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button18.png"                      alt="subscribe-button18"                ></p><p><strong>Step 19:</strong> Do the same with the cursor. Double click on the cursor in the time and add a key frame at its actual position.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button19.png"                      alt="subscribe-button19"                ></p><p><strong>Step 20:</strong> Move ahead when you want it to disappear. Move the cursor out of the screen and click ‘OK’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button20.png"                      alt="subscribe-button20"                ></p><p><strong>Step 21:</strong> Your Subscribe png gif is ready to be exported and used in your videos. Click on export and choose from various formats and options to choose from while exporting it.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button21.png"                      alt="subscribe-button21"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>How to Get People to Subscribe Channel</strong></a></p><p>Conclusion：Your own Animated Subscribe Button is ready to be used in your future videos and projects.

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube. In order for people to find your videos, you’ll have to include a keyword in your video’s title.</p><p>Once you have a keyword in mind, type it into the Explore bar at the top of your page in Google Trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-topic-in-google-trends.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Keywords YouTube Video"                ></p><p>What happens after you click <strong>enter</strong> is pretty much magic. Say I want to make a video on how to use Filmora. The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902278/19272" target="_top" id="1902278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902278/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free and it gives you all kinds of extra info about videos and channels.</em></p><p>The second-highest ranked result is only 2 months old and isn’t from a huge channel. Although there is competition for this keyword, ranking for it is not impossible. It also helps that software reviews are a topic where people will always be looking for the latest information&#x2F;newest videos.</p><p>If the search results for your keyword are dominated by monster channels with millions of subs, and you can’t think of an angle you can use to crack into those top results (i.e. having newer information people will be looking for, which the more established videos are lacking), then maybe try the search with your second best keyword and see if there’s a better opportunity for you to rank there.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of identifying trends and making videos about them quickly is that you can get in before there’s a lot of competition for the first few pages of search results on YouTube or Google, and before larger channels start making videos of their own on the same topic.</p><p>Want to make coming up with YouTube video ideas a habit? <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >This post here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you develop a process to generate more ideas and properly evaluate them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Making Better YouTube Videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers, Filmora provides plentiful editing tools, such as cut, trim, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >noise removal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >chroma key compositing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and color grading.

Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora"><a href="#1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can find them easily by typing bokeh in the search bar in Effects.</p><p>Note: you should select <strong>Included</strong> to see all bokeh effects pre-programmed in Filmora. If you need more visual effects, just go to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Filmstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> effects store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-bokeh-effect.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Bokeh effect "                ></p><p>Double click the bokeh effect to preview the result, and if you find the bokeh effect fits the video, just drop it to the track above the video.

For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.</p><p>My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Become YouTube Partner should be easier"                ></p><p><em>I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those.</em></p><p>However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.</p><h4 id="1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number"><a href="#1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number" class="headerlink" title="1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number"></a>1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number</h4><p>This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.</p><p>Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).</p><p>If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.</p><h4 id="2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money"><a href="#2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money" class="headerlink" title="2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money"></a>2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg"                      alt=" the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube"                ></p><p><em>Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight.</em></p><p>How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.</p><p>You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.</p><p>It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.</p><h4 id="3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized"><a href="#3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized" class="headerlink" title="3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized"></a>3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized</h4><p>YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.</p><p>Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process.

The minimum width of the image is 640 pixels.</li><li>About the YouTube Image thumbnail format: Use .JPG, .PNG, .GIF or .BMP files for your thumbnail image.</li><li>You’ll want your thumbnails to stand out. Bright colored text is a simple, easy way to draw people’s attention. Red, white, yellow, or orange are all popular choices.</li><li>You can even do a little homework to see what colors others are using for similar videos to yours, and then choose different colors to stand out.</li></ul><p>One word of warning: your thumbnail should be related to the content of your video. Misleading thumbnail images, if reported, will reflect poorly on your channel. You’ll get a negative rating in the community status part of your channel. This can actually remove your ability to use custom thumbnails, so keep it honest!</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make YouTube Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>To make a creative YouTube video, you may also need a powerful video editing software.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068440/7443" target="_top" id="2068440">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068440" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068440/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p><p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p><p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "                ></p><p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p><p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p><h4 id="3-People-Like-People"><a href="#3-People-Like-People" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p><p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p><p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p><p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p><h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p><p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p><p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p><h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p><p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"                ></p><p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p><h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p><p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail</h3><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="1.

What is YouTube Thumbnail?</h4><p>When you upload a video on YouTube, YouTube gives you three images to choose from in the selection of your video’s thumbnail image.
