It can be extremely discouraging at first. More experienced vloggers know that mistakes happen and they are no reason to stop recording. Instead of trying to record a perfect clip it is common for vloggers to remove errors from their videos in editing using jump cuts.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1"><a href="#How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog"></a>How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a Jump Cut?"></a>1. What is a Jump Cut?</h4><p>A jump cut is when you jump from one part of your clip to a later part of that same clip, cutting out the section in-between.</p><p>In movies or tv shows jump cuts can be distracting. In vlogs it is the exact opposite; jump cuts are used to remove distractions. It is not strange for a YouTube video to contain a lot of jump cuts. If you go and re-watch a video by your favorite vlogger you will probably notice that every once in a while the vlogger is suddenly sitting differently or that something else has suddenly changed. That is a jump cut, and chances are you did not even think twice about it when you first watched the video.</p><h4 id="2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video"><a href="#2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video"></a>2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video</h4><p>There are a lot of things you might want to take out of your clips using jump cuts. Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>Repetition</strong>: You may have had to repeat yourself because you misspoke. Or, you might watch your clip back and realize that two sections you intended – perhaps even scripted – are very similar and you only need one.</p><p><strong>Off-Topic Tangents</strong>: Once you get comfortable talking to the camera it is easy to find yourself getting off-topic while recording. These tangents might be funny or feel important, but you should still cut them out of your final video. Rather than scrapping them completely, though, consider giving your tangent its very own video. Successful vloggers post new videos frequently, after all.</p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: Use jump cuts to take out any pauses in your video. Every period of silence is an opportunity for viewers to get distracted and decide to click on something else. Adding music to the background of your video can help with shorter pauses, but cutting out any silence is still a good way to go.</p><p>In the video tutorial below, we will share with you some practical and creative jump cuts tips that you can try in video editing. And most of the jump cuts are done with the cutting features in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos"></a>3. How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos</h4><p>You can make jump cuts in almost every editing program, from free software like Windows Movie Maker to professional programs like Adobe Premiere. Remember no matter which video editing software you are using to edit your videos with jump cut, you need to ensure that the software can scroll through your video clips and audio files frame-by-frame. And some video editors may only allow you to scroll video footage frame by frame. This tutorial is for Filmora Video Editor (Now upgraded to Filmora), but many of the same steps will apply to other software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to trim and cut videos in Windows Movie Maker for Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Open up Filmora Video Editor and add a clip into the timeline. Watch it through, and then revisit sections where you think you might want to make cuts.</p><p>Find a place in your clip that has silence and use the scissors icon to cut your clip into two. Then start playing your clip and pause as soon as you hear sound.</p><p>Make sure your clip is selected, and then go back frame by frame until you hear nothing.</p><p>Use the scissors icon to make another cut. You will now have three clips; one before the silence, the silent pause, and the section where sound starts again. Delete the quiet middle clip.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views"><a href="#4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep video shorter for more views"></a>4. Keep video shorter for more views</h4><p>The videos that get the most views on YouTube are an average of three minutes long. People will use the length of a video as a reason not to click on it. Viewers are also more likely to get distracted and stop watching longer videos before they are over. That does not mean you should not take as long as you need to properly explain your ideas, just that you should be careful your video is not longer than it needs to be. It is common for youtubers to use only about a third of the clip they record. The rest is removed using jump cuts.</p><p>Filmora video editor will help you to be more creative in video editing and saving your time at the same time.

New technologies and features like AI (artificial intelligence), AR (augmented reality) have made possible things we couldn’t even imagine at the turn of the century.</p><p>Scroll down to find out this infographic made by <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. And get to know more about the hottest social media trends in 2018 and feel free to let us know what you think in the comments section. Hit share and tell your friends and colleagues about the future of the Internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-social-media-trends-2018.jpg"                      alt="top social media trends 2018"                ></p><p>In 2017, 90% of all content shared by Internet users is <strong>video</strong>, and this trend will continue in 2018 because all of the most popular social networks are investing in video features because they believe it can help them generate better user engagement. Furthermore, the ephemeral content, the type of content that is available for less than 24 hours, is on the rise, which means that Instagram or Snapchat stories must be considered as a channel for brand promotion in the next year and in years to come.</p><p><strong>Chatbots</strong> represent a significant force on the market since 80% of chatbots can be utilized for providing non-stop services. Some estimations say that up to 30% of all chat conversations on the Internet will be with chatbots as soon as 2018. Despite the rapid automatization of the Internet, influencers still play a large role in online marketing, and they will continue to do so because they can produce a ten-time rise in conversion rates. Over 90% of people who at one point used influencer marketing think that it is an effective marketing technique that almost certainly provides results.</p><p>One force on the market that needs to be reckoned with are <strong>Smartphones</strong>. The amount of time an average internet user spends on social networks from their Smartphone is significantly larger than the amount of time spent on those same networks from a desktop computer. This means that optimizing online content for Smartphones will become even more important in 2018, than it already is.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming Takes the Center Stage</strong>. Some studies have shown that 80% of customers would prefer to watch a live video streamed by a brand than to read a post. To make things even more interesting, it is estimated that by 2020 80% of Internet traffic will be generated by video content and the video streaming market could easily become $70,5 billion industry by 2021 if its growth continues at this pace.</p><p>As of today <strong>Generation Z</strong> already has $44 billion of buying power and this number will continue to grow as the time passes. For that reason, brands and companies will have to adjust their offers to meet the demands of this rising force on the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload

You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="clearing the youtube watch later playlist"                ></p><h5 id="Using-A-Script"><a href="#Using-A-Script" class="headerlink" title="Using A Script"></a>Using A Script</h5><p>Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> browser on your system and head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website**.** Next, select the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the left pane and click <strong>“Watch Later”</strong> from the menu.</p><p>Step2 Now, hit the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + J”</strong> keys on Windows or the <strong>“Command + Option+ J”</strong> buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png"                      alt="using script to clear watch later"                ></p><p>Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.</p><p>setInterval(function () { document.querySelector(‘#primary button[aria-label&#x3D;”Action menu”]‘).click(); var things &#x3D; document.evaluate(‘&#x2F;&#x2F;span[contains(text(),”Remove from”)]‘, document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null ); for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);</p><p>Step4 In the last step, hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some.

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record"></a><strong>1. Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record</strong></h3><p>When you’re recording audio, you have to be more aware of the subtle sounds that drone on in your background. These sounds may include humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, and jingling from your pet’s collar. Observe your recording space and find ways to silence everything that you don’t want in your audio recording.</p><h3 id="2-Put-your-mobile-phone-in-airplane-mode"><a href="#2-Put-your-mobile-phone-in-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode"></a><strong>2. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode</strong></h3><p>Although it may be quite obvious to turn your phone’s ring tone off when you’re recording, it may not be as obvious to put your phone in airplane mode. When phones receive calls or perform searches as part of their background processes, they emit signals that can get picked up by your recording system. Avoid ruining good takes with unwanted sounds of phone signals by putting your phones in airplane mode.</p><h3 id="3-Minimize-echo"><a href="#3-Minimize-echo" class="headerlink" title="3. Minimize echo"></a><strong>3. Minimize echo</strong></h3><p>If you are recording yourself talk or sing, make sure to set up your recording space in a way where the sound projected from your voice bounces minimally off the walls and back to your microphone. Bare walls and hardwood floors will cause a lot of bouncing. Make use of materials that will absorb your sound rather than bounce it, like a thick rug or a comforter. If you want your voice to echo, that’s something you should do in post-production.</p><h3 id="4-Block-wind-from-reaching-your-microphone"><a href="#4-Block-wind-from-reaching-your-microphone" class="headerlink" title="4. Block wind from reaching your microphone"></a><strong>4. Block wind from reaching your microphone</strong></h3><p>Although it might not sound so loud and distracting to the naked ear, wind sounds terribly loud through a microphone recording and can cause your audio to clip (distortion of waveform due to output of sound exceeding maximum capacity or 0 dB point). This includes the “wind” that comes out of your mouth when you pronounce words starting with the letter “p.” Use pop filters, windscreens, and deadcats to block wind from reaching your microphone.</p><h3 id="5-Upgrade-your-microphone"><a href="#5-Upgrade-your-microphone" class="headerlink" title="5. Upgrade your microphone"></a><strong>5. Upgrade your microphone</strong></h3><p>As much as you try to control all the noise in your surroundings, your greatest recording limitation will come from the hardware that you use. Improve your recordings by plugging in an external microphone into your camera’s microphone jack or record audio completely separately with a professional microphone.</p><p>Need help with deciding on a microphone to buy? Check out our recommended list of microphones.</p><h3 id="6-Adjust-your-levels"><a href="#6-Adjust-your-levels" class="headerlink" title="6. Adjust your levels"></a><strong>6. Adjust your levels</strong></h3><p>Before pressing the record button, see how loudly your microphone picks up the sound you wish to record. Adjust your levels (sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound sits in between -6 dBs and -12dBs. This range gives the source of your sound some room to get louder without the recorded audio getting clipped. When you first listen to audio recorded within this range, it may sound very quiet. No need to worry though because you can increase the volume later in editing.</p><h3 id="7-Start-with-a-sound-cue-if-you’re-planning-to-do-some-syncing-in-post"><a href="#7-Start-with-a-sound-cue-if-you’re-planning-to-do-some-syncing-in-post" class="headerlink" title="7. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post"></a><strong>7. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post</strong></h3><p>If you’re recording separate audio that you plan to sync to your video later in editing, start your recording with a short and loud sound cue like a clap or a high pitched “beep” tone. Later, when you’re editing, it’ll be much easier for you to find the section where your video and additional audio match.</p><h3 id="8-Get-close-to-the-sound"><a href="#8-Get-close-to-the-sound" class="headerlink" title="8. Get close to the sound"></a><strong>8. Get close to the sound</strong></h3><p>Unless you’re aiming to record ambient sound, bring your microphone close to the source of sound you are wanting to record. The closer your microphone is to the source of sound, the lower your sensitivity setting can be on your microphone. As a result of lowering your levels, sounds you are not meaning to record will also sound fainter.</p><h3 id="9-ADR"><a href="#9-ADR" class="headerlink" title="9. ADR"></a><strong>9. ADR</strong></h3><p>When you need to record a scene in a loud setting where you have very little control over the noise, record additional vocals later and replace the original vocals through a process called automated dialogue replacement.</p><h3 id="10-Record-Ambient-Sound"><a href="#10-Record-Ambient-Sound" class="headerlink" title="10. Record Ambient Sound"></a><strong>10. Record Ambient Sound</strong></h3><p>Remember to record ambient sound or “room tone.” You can use these recordings to fill in the blanks if you run out of audio and also smooth out parts of your audio where you hear pops, clicks, and other unwanted noise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-outshine-others-expert-tips-on-making-youtube-shorts-pop/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Outshine Others  Expert Tips on Making YouTube Shorts Pop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/-marvel-intro-makers-online/"><u>Top 4 Marvel Intro Makers Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-backward-playbook-youtubes-video-flip/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Backward Playbook  YouTube's Video Flip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ocial-broadcast-battleground-fb-live-yt-live-twitvision/"><u>[New] Social Broadcast Battleground  FB Live, YT Live, TwitVision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-free-easy-and-fast-youtubes-best-subtitle-getters/"><u>2024 Approved  Free, Easy and Fast  YouTube's Best Subtitle Getters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-channel-expansion-sharing-your-show-across-30-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Channel Expansion  Sharing Your Show Across 30 Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/nderstanding-your-earning-potential-youtubes-latest-rules/"><u>[New] Understanding Your Earning Potential - YouTube's Latest Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-call-logs-from-honor-magic-6-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - undelete lost call logs from Honor Magic 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-audacitys-noise-suppression-techniques-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated Understanding Audacitys Noise Suppression Techniques Step-by-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-integrate-efficiently-with-azures-speech-technology/"><u>[New] Integrate Efficiently with Azure's Speech Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/overcoming-the-challenge-of-acoustic-reflections-in-sound-engineering-for-2024/"><u>Overcoming the Challenge of Acoustic Reflections in Sound Engineering for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-supreme-4k-display-selection-the-best-of-ten/"><u>[New] Supreme 4K Display Selection  The Best of Ten</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-leveraging-vlc-media-player-for-remote-streaming/"><u>In 2024, Leveraging VLC Media Player for Remote Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-leading-tech-advances-top-5-windows-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leading Tech Advances  Top 5 Windows Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/2024-approved-movavi-video-editor-plus-review/"><u>2024 Approved Movavi Video Editor Plus Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p><p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p><h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p><p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p><p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p><h2 id="2-Shotcut"><a href="#2-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="**2. Shotcut"></a>**2. Shotcut</h2><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed audio editing</li><li>Color grading, ability to save presets</li><li>Fairly intuitive timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Shotcut-Review"><a href="#Shotcut-Review" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p><p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p><p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p><h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express" class="headerlink" title="**3. Hitfilm Express"></a>**3. Hitfilm Express</h2><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Compositing mode (2D and 3D)</li><li>The Most effect customization</li><li>Helpful User Guide &amp; tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Can be overwhelming</li><li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li></ol><h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p><p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p><p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p><p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p><h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p><h2 id="4-VideoPad-Video-Editor"><a href="#4-VideoPad-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**4. VideoPad Video Editor"></a>**4. VideoPad Video Editor</h2><h4 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to jump into</li><li>Moving text</li><li>Huge audio waveforms</li><li>Audio and visual effects</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>No longer updated</li></ol><h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><h2 id="5-Lightworks"><a href="#5-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="**5. Lightworks"></a>**5. Lightworks</h2><h4 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed color and audio editing</li><li>Multicam editing</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li><li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li></ol><h4 id="Lightworks-Review"><a href="#Lightworks-Review" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p><h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p><p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p><p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**6. VSDC Video Editor"></a>**6. VSDC Video Editor</h2><h4 id="Pros-5"><a href="#Pros-5" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Diagrams and charts</strong></li><li>How To Get Started Guide</li><li>Lots of features</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Very confusing</li><li>Paid features show up in the free version, but they’re blocked</li></ol><h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite" class="headerlink" title="**7. Machete Video Editor Lite"></a>**7. Machete Video Editor Lite</h2><h4 id="Pros-6"><a href="#Pros-6" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Cannot swap or add audio</li><li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li><li>Slightly awkward timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux"><a href="#8-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="**8. Avidemux"></a>**8. Avidemux</h2><h4 id="Pros-7"><a href="#Pros-7" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Can add subtitle files</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-5"><a href="#Cons-5" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Not intuitive</li><li>Doesn’t support MOV or WMV</li><li>The website is not informative, no tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Avidemux-Review"><a href="#Avidemux-Review" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-step-by-step-guide-for-earning-from-every-youtube-short/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide for Earning From Every YouTube Short</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-dissecting-the-hidden-mechanics-behind-youtubes-popularity-index/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Dissecting the Hidden Mechanics Behind YouTube's Popularity Index</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/youtube-boundaries-with-creative-studio-expertise-and-tactics/"><u>Push Youtube Boundaries with Creative Studio Expertise and Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ll-time-highest-chart-youtubes-premier-video-list/"><u>[New] All-Time Highest Chart  YouTube's Premier Video List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/nstant-video-visionary-for-2024/"><u>[New] Instant Video Visionary for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ce-your-content-creation-with-these-top-12-cameras-for-2024/"><u>Enhance Your Content Creation with These Top 12 Cameras for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-elevating-your-channels-ranking-simple-strategies-unveiled/"><u>2024 Approved  Elevating Your Channel's Ranking  Simple Strategies Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-youtube-income-101-from-ideas-to-earnings-in-action/"><u>In 2024, YouTube Income 101  From Ideas to Earnings in Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/-soundscape-youtube-audio-enhancement-guide/"><u>Clean Soundscape  YouTube Audio Enhancement Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-twitters-visuals-saving-and-downloading-on-smartphones/"><u>[Updated] Twitter's Visuals  Saving and Downloading on Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/chorus-of-creativity-the-mac-studio-experience-for-2024/"><u>Chorus of Creativity  The Mac Studio Experience for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-art-of-using-kinemaster-techniques-and-top-online-video-editors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Art of Using KineMaster  Techniques and Top Online Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-top-choice-for-fb-vids-mp4-download-toolkit/"><u>[New] Top Choice for FB Vids – MP4 Download Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-you-transfer-files-from-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-to-iphone-151413-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can You Transfer Files From Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro To iPhone 15/14/13? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/tailoring-melodies-for-youtube-personalized-list-creation/"><u>Tailoring Melodies for YouTube  Personalized List Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-tiktok-username/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Your TikTok Username</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-motorola-moto-g14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Motorola Moto G14 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-5-ps3-emulation-software-pc-edition-2023/"><u>[Updated] Top 5 Ps3 Emulation Software - PC Edition, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-crafting-the-core-plot/"><u>[New] Crafting the Core Plot</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There are millions of videos on YouTube, so if you want the audience to click on yours, then you need to make a great first impression.</p><ol><li><a href="#ideal"><strong>What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#perfect"><strong>Tips for Perfect Thumbnails</strong></a></li><li><a href="#better"><strong>Making Better Thumbnails for YouTube</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="1-What’s-the-ideal-YouTube-thumbnail-Size-and-Dimension"><a href="#1-What’s-the-ideal-YouTube-thumbnail-Size-and-Dimension" class="headerlink" title="1. What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?"></a><strong>1. What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels. Generally, the 16:9 ratio is considered as an ideal choice for Most of YouTube previews and players.</p><p>Here is one interesting thing that you need to know; the thumbnail of videos appears smaller during searches, but it naturally grows to the full size of a video during suggestions. Now the fact is that upscaling of images often loses the quality of content, whereas it is much easier to downscale larger images into smaller ones. Hence, the best idea is to use large size images so that this search and suggestion based scaling needs can be well accomplished.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 12 Best Free YouTube Thumbnail Makers &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Mac] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2.

Although the idea is good and original, these thumbnails use to be of low quality with blur details. Hope! You don’t want to lose your audience with this bad selection.</p><h4 id="Custom-Thumbnails"><a href="#Custom-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Custom Thumbnails"></a><strong>Custom Thumbnails</strong></h4><p>This is probably the best choice for your customized videos, and the interesting thing is that here you can control everything manually with lots of useful effects.</p><p>First of all, you need to open your video on YouTube and then scrub a useful still from your video that you wish to use as a thumbnail.</p><p>Now, you need to take a screenshot of this particular instance of your video file. The best part is that most of the operating systems allow users to enjoy several shortcuts to complete this task. For example:</p><p>Mac users need to press Command+Shift+4 and then simply highlight the area that you want to include in your screenshot with the help of a frame. The system will automatically save your selected area to your desktop in the form of an image.</p><p>Window users are advised to access Windows Key with Print Screen option to get their desired screenshot.</p><p>Once you are ready with your video specific still image, then simply get it uploaded on YouTube using the edit video page.</p><h2 id="3-Making-Better-Thumbnails-for-YouTube"><a href="#3-Making-Better-Thumbnails-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="3. Making Better Thumbnails for YouTube"></a>3. Making Better Thumbnails for YouTube</h2><p>The best part is to access some photo editing software tool to edit your image the way you like. You can use an advanced tool like Photoshop or a free online tool like Canva.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Focus on Size:</em></strong></li></ul><p>It is always advised to create thumbnail images with standard video file size; the most commonly used standard size range is 1980x1080 or 1280x720. Images having a size smaller than this range may often appear blurry.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Add Text:</em></strong></li></ul><p>The best idea is to use text-based editing for your thumbnail images and preferably add the title of your video to this image. It will naturally attract more viewers.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Borders matter:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Professionals recommend adding borders around thumbnail images but do not try to make it too thick rather, try to make it noticeable with fine details.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Background editing:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Most of the expert video thumbnail developers prefer to change the impact of thumbnail background by simply replacing the background color with solid colors. It will definitely attract more viewers and will bring major attention to the major subject.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Test it before uploading:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Before uploading your customized thumbnail to your YouTube channel, prefer to check its final view. Zoom in to check the appearance of the thumbnail image on the larger screen, and it should also look fine when sized down.</p><p>Now that you know the best YouTube thumbnail size and how to design better thumbnails, do you think you’ll revisit the thumbnails of your existing YouTube videos?</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.

Times them to music</li><li>Guides you with pop-up tips</li><li>No text&#x2F;title overlays</li><li>Exports directly to YouTube</li></ol><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a professional-grade desktop editor, and Adobe Premiere Clip lives up to the quality standards set by its big-brother software. It is missing some features you might want for YouTube videos, like title effects, but it does have some bells and whistles. There’s a good selection of filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-filters.jpg"                      alt="adobe premiere filters"                ></p><p>Making changes to your picture, like adjusting the exposure or the prevalence of highlights or shadows, is just a matter of sliding bars. The tools for splitting and duplicating clips are easy to find too. You just toggle between the two icons right above your video – the one that looks like a shutter and the one that looks like adjustment bars – to switch between the picture tools and the other tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-clip-options.jpg"                      alt="adobe premiere clip options"                ></p><p>You cannot add what you might normally think of as a title effect in Adobe Premiere Clip, so it’ll be hard to fully complete your video. You can add text cards to put in-between your video clips, but you can’t overlay the title on top of a clip.</p><p>You can share your video directly to YouTube when you export.</p><h2 id="Cameo"><a href="#Cameo" class="headerlink" title="Cameo"></a>Cameo</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-ios.jpg"                      alt="cameo ios"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Easy-to-apply themes</li><li>Customizable titles</li><li>Limited features</li><li>Exports to 4K (if your clips are 4K)</li></ol><p>Vimeo is a video sharing site with more of a ‘filmmaker’ focus than YouTube, so it isn’t a surprise that their mobile editing app Cameo can export high-quality 4K videos.</p><p>Like some of the other apps on this list, Cameo does not have a huge variety of functions. You can reorder your clips, trim them, add titles, and apply themes (essentially filter and title combos).</p><p>There are three icons on the main interface: Scissors, a Music Note, and Filters.</p><p>The Scissors will take you to the trimming screen, where you can make your clip shorter or longer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-interface.jpg"                      alt="cameo interface"                ></p><p>You can also add a title in the trimming screen, but you will not be able to change the font style or color until you are in the Filter screen.</p><p>In the Filter screen (tap the overlapping filters icon on the main interface) you will be able to adjust the color of your text by tapping on the circle with the A in it. Tapping where it says ‘Font’ will change your font style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-font.jpg"                      alt="cameo font"                ></p><p>You can also tap on Themes and choose a premade style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-crush-style.jpg"                      alt="cameo crush style"                ></p><p>Here’s what ‘Crush’ looks like applied:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-crush-preview.jpg"                      alt="cameo crush preview"                ></p><p>My font was changed, and there’s also a filter now. In order to apply a filter, you must start with a theme.</p><h2 id="Clips"><a href="#Clips" class="headerlink" title="Clips"></a>Clips</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-ios.jpg"                      alt="clips ios"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Great selection of stickers</li><li>Lacks some basic tools</li><li>Simple interface</li></ol><p>Clips is an intuitive app with a lot of options for decorating your videos. It is lacking in some of the more basic editings features you might expect (i.e. you cannot split clips or do any color correction), but it has a lot of fun features like stickers and emojis that could make up for that depending on your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-stickers-emojis.jpg"                      alt="clips stickers&amp;emojis"                ></p><p>There are also more traditional effects, like filters and titles. There are a wide range of title options in styles that are popular on YouTube, and a fairly standard filter selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-effects.jpg"                      alt="clips effects"                ></p><p>While you cannot split clips in this app, but trimming and reordering them is easy. For trimming, you just select the clip and then Trim to open a screen where you can drag the start and end points of the clip.</p><p>To rearrange your clips, just tap the clip you want to move and hold down. You’ll be able to drag it to a new location.</p><p>It’d be hard to rely on Clips exclusively as your YouTube video editor, but it’s well suited for Instagram or for making quick ‘on-the-go’ videos.</p><h2 id="Filmora-Android"><a href="#Filmora-Android" class="headerlink" title="Filmora ( Android"></a>Filmora ( <strong>Android</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Export directly to YouTube</li><li>16:9 or 1:1 for Instagram</li><li>Includes effects like transitions, filters, and overlays</li><li>End-roll logo</li></ol><p>You can make a complete video easily just by tapping and dragging in Filmora, and there are even effects like filters, transitions, and overlays you can add to make your video more polished.</p><p>After importing your media into Filmora (you can import videos and photos saved on your phone, or media which has been uploaded to a social media account like Facebook or Instagram) you can change the order of your clips by tapping one, pressing down for a moment, and then dragging your clips where you want them.</p><p>Trimming a clip is as simple as tapping on it and then Duration. You’ll get this screen where you can adjust the length easily by dragging the markers to beginning or endpoints.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-trim-clip.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Trim&amp;Clip"                ></p><p>Cropping and zooming are simple too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-crop-zoom.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Crop&amp;Zoom"                ></p><p>Filmora comes with pre-made themes you can apply which include titles, filters, and other effects. These might not be ideal if you already have branding you like to use for YouTube, but in some situations, they can make video creation a lot faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-effects.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Effects"                ></p><p>Filmora comes loaded with music, or you can even import your own music from your phone.</p><p>Once you’re done, tap ‘save’ in the top right corner of your screen to export your video. From the save screen, you’ll be able to export your video directly to YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-save-export.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Save&amp;Export"                ></p><p>One potential drawback is that Filmora will add its own logo to the end of your exported video. This logo will not distract from your video content since it is added at the end and never overlaps any of your clips, but it still might not be ideal for all creators.</p><h2 id="Funimate-Android"><a href="#Funimate-Android" class="headerlink" title="Funimate ( Android"></a>Funimate ( Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funimate-android-ios.jpg"                      alt="Funimate"                ></p><p> <strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Easily add text and shapes</li><li>Rainbow doodling</li><li>Shake effects</li><li>Small ‘Funimate’ watermark in videos from the free version</li></ol><p>Funimate is lives up to the ‘fun’ promise in its name. It’s designed mostly for music videos&#x2F;Musical.ly and while it is missing a lot of more typical editing options, there are a few free tools in Funimate that other apps just don’t have.</p><p>For example, there are shake and distortion effects available through Funimate that you usually only find in desktop software.</p><p>You can also draw rainbow designs on your video with your finger – no other app on this list can do that.</p><p>The text tool in Funimate is easy to use, and there are cool looking glow effects you can apply in the color selection screen. Those options are also available when you’re adding shapes, likes stars and sparkles.</p><p>Funimate is not built for typical editing, which is both its strength and its weakness. Trimming your clips is its own stage which you must complete before you start adding effects, and you cannot split clips or add multiple clips.</p><p>The free version of Funimate does add a small watermark to your videos in the bottom-right corner, but it is subtle enough that I almost missed it completely while reviewing the app.</p><h2 id="iMovie"><a href="#iMovie" class="headerlink" title="iMovie"></a>iMovie</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-ios.jpg"                      alt="iMovie"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Trailer templates</li><li>Themes</li><li>Limited tools and resources</li></ol><p>iMovie’s mobile app is designed for ease and includes things like ‘trailer templates’ and themes that allow you to make a video quickly and with minimal effort.</p><p>This streamlined app is limited in its features. Other apps on this list have left out color correction tools or clip splitting tools and instead loaded up on decorative features like stickers, emojis, and overlays. iMovie has left out these tools and does not have an abundance of decorative features either.</p><p>There are filters, themes, and titles, however.</p><p>The titles are simple but polished, and you’ll find all the standard types of filters.</p><p>The themes include a variety of graphics and are applied to your entire video, not individual clips. You can also apply one filter to your entire video.</p><p>iMovie also includes a decent selection of transitions, which you can apply easily by tapping the area between two clips.</p><h2 id="Movie-Maker-Filmmaker-by-Alive-Android"><a href="#Movie-Maker-Filmmaker-by-Alive-Android" class="headerlink" title="Movie Maker Filmmaker by Alive ( Android"></a>Movie Maker Filmmaker by Alive ( Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-maker-filmmaker-alive.jpg"                      alt="Movie Maker Filmmaker by Alive"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Good title tool</li><li>Stickers</li><li>Change clip duration</li><li>16:9 or 1:1</li></ol><p>Movie Maker Filmmaker (the app will be labeled ‘Alive’ in on your phone) has a lot of features that will help you put together a fun YouTube video. There’s a great selection of stickers, filters, and overlays and they’re all easy to apply. You just click on what you want and resize&#x2F;reposition it in the player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-maker-filmmaker-filters.jpg"                      alt="Movie Maker Filmmaker Filters"                ></p><p>This app is missing a lot of basic editing features, however. You cannot adjust things like brightness or saturation. This won’t be a problem if you’re happy with your clips as-is, but it’s a bit odd to not have those options.</p><p>There is a text tool and while it is fairly basic, it is also flexible. There is a good selection of fonts to choose from, and you can also choose whether or not you want a colored background, and if your text should have a shadow.</p><p>Once you’ve decided on the look of your text you can drag it, resize it, and tilt it however you want in the preview screen.</p><p>A slightly odd feature of this app is that it doesn’t save your video to your phone or export it directly to YouTube. Instead, it saves it – and shares it – within the app and gives you the option of sharing it with YouTube after.</p><h2 id="Power-Director"><a href="#Power-Director" class="headerlink" title="Power Director"></a>Power Director</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/power-director-android.jpg"                      alt="Power Director"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>A timeline like desktop software</li><li>All the basic editing features</li><li>Lots of transitions</li><li>Videos from the free version will be watermarked</li></ol><p>The first thing you’ll notice when you open up Power Director is that the interface looks a lot like the interface of a lot of desktop editors with a very classic timeline. This familiarity could make it easy to jump into if you’re used to editing on your laptop.</p><p>However, Power Director is a bit less intuitive than most of the other apps on this list. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s difficult to use – it isn’t, it’s much easier than a lot of desktop software – but among mobile apps designed for streamlined efficiency it does stand out as being a bit harder to dive into.</p><p>That is partly because there’s a lot you can do with it. It has the tools you would expect in an editor. You can split and trim clips, and you have all the standard color tools including some that most mobile apps leave out.</p><p>A lot of apps have Brightness, Contrast, and Saturation, but PowerDirector also has Color Temperature and Tint.</p><p>In addition to editing tools, PowerDirector has bells and whistles like filters –</p><p>- and a ton of great transitions.</p><p>One drawback of PowerDirector is that the free version will watermark your videos. This watermark is not intrusive, but it isn’t as subtle as the Funimate one either.</p><p>You can export videos from PowerDirector directly to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Vlogit-Android"><a href="#Vlogit-Android" class="headerlink" title="Vlogit ( Android"></a>Vlogit ( Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogit-android-ios.jpg"                      alt="Vlogit"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Easy thumbnail maker</li><li>Export directly to YouTube</li><li>Animated stickers</li></ol><p>Vlogit is also an app from the creators of the Filmora Video Editor. It isn’t quite as intuitive as Filmora, but the major benefit of Vlogit for YouTube creators is that it was designed with you in mind. It has features like animated stickers, emojis, and a thumbnail maker which were included specifically because YouTubers and vloggers need them.</p><p>All the usual adjustments you might want to make, like saturation or sharpness, are easy in Vlogit. So are adjustments to the length or crop of clips.</p><p>After you save your video you’ll have the option of creating a thumbnail using a screenshot from your video. You can add a colored border, text, emojis, and more!</p><p>Once you’re done, you can export directly to YouTube. Like Filmora, Vlogit does have a post-video logo roll.</p><p> Have you ever used a free mobile app to edit one of your YouTube videos?

In theory, these recommendations are based on your viewing habits and you’re only directed to videos you’re interested in.</p><p>Except we all know that’s not always what happens.</p><p>YouTube’s recommendations are based on more than just what you’ve watched and searched for, and sometimes even the data on that can get skewed over time. Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.</p><p>Here’s what you can do about it:</p><ol><li><a href="#manage"><strong>Manage Your Watch History</strong></a></li><li><a href="#notinterested"><strong>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</strong></a></li><li><a href="#butwhy"><strong>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Manage-Your-Watch-History"><a href="#Manage-Your-Watch-History" class="headerlink" title="Manage Your Watch History"></a>Manage Your Watch History</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg"                      alt="Manage Watch History"                ></p><p>Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked <strong>History</strong> with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the <strong>Account</strong> tab and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.</p><p>If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.</p><h2 id="Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested"><a href="#Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested" class="headerlink" title="Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested"></a>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg"                      alt="Tell YouTube Not Interested"                ></p><p>Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like. However, they have no way of automatically collecting data on what kinds of videos you’d rather not see.</p><p>What they do have is a system for you to flag recommendations you don’t like.</p><p>Hover over the thumbnail of a video you don’t want to be recommended to you and a small icon that looks like three stacked dots will appear next to the title. Click on that, and then click <strong>Not Interested</strong>.</p><p>When you tell YouTube you aren’t interested in certain videos they use that data to adjust what they recommend for you.</p><h2 id="But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like"><a href="#But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like" class="headerlink" title="But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?"></a>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</h2><p>Your search&#x2F;watch history is not the only thing that determines what YouTube recommends for you. Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a

On the other hand, the ‘Featured’ videos are suggested according to what YouTube ‘thinks’ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.</p><p>Therefore, when any clip is added as a ‘Featured’ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the ‘Recommended’ category.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Although there is a lot more to cover under the ‘Featured’ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.</p><p>Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the ‘Featured’ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube on your PC’s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click <strong>Your videos</strong> from the navigation bar in the left, and click <strong>Customization</strong> from the left bar when the <strong>Studio</strong> page opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg"                      alt="Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts</strong></p><p>Click <strong>ADD SECTION</strong> from the <strong>Layout</strong> tab in the right window, and click <strong>Short videos</strong> from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg"                      alt="Add Section in Featured Section"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes</strong></p><p>Hold the <strong>Short videos</strong> bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the <strong>Featured sections</strong> segment. Once the <strong>Short videos</strong> category is in the right place, click <strong>PUBLISH</strong> from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as ‘Featured’ after its approval.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg"                      alt="Publish Added Section in Featured Section"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Create-Attractive-Thumbnail-for-YouTube-Shorts-to-Get-More-Views"><a href="#Part-2-Create-Attractive-Thumbnail-for-YouTube-Shorts-to-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views"></a>Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views</h2><p>The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.</p><p>To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.</p><p><strong>Things to Consider</strong> <strong>for creating attractive thumbnail</strong></p><p>While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:</p><ul><li><strong>Relevance</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.</p><ul><li><strong>Clarity</strong></li></ul><p>Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.</p><ul><li><strong>Correctness</strong></li></ul><p>You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Optimize-YouTube-Shorts-to-Get-More-Views"><a href="#Part-3-Optimize-YouTube-Shorts-to-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views"></a>Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views</h2><p>The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos aren’t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.</p><p>A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:</p><ul><li><strong>Attractive Thumbnail</strong></li></ul><p>As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.</p><ul><li><strong>Compelling Title</strong></li></ul><p>The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.</p><ul><li><strong>Detailed Description</strong></li></ul><p>The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.</p><ul><li><strong>Tags</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding ‘#Shorts’ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and&#x2F;or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="Filmora-Best-YouTube-Shorts-Video-Editor-for-PC"><a href="#Filmora-Best-YouTube-Shorts-Video-Editor-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Filmora - Best YouTube Shorts Video Editor for PC"></a>Filmora - Best YouTube Shorts Video Editor for PC</h3><ul><li>Easily record a video on PC and Mac.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quickly with a wide range of gaming effects.</li><li>Rich video tempaltes and resources for YouTube videos.</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Analyze-YouTube-Shorts-Performance"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Analyze-YouTube-Shorts-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance"></a>Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance</h2><p>YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the ‘Featured’ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.</p><p>However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.</p><p><strong>FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?</strong></p><p>Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channel’s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-exploring-12-premium-cameras-for-professional-vloggers/"><u>In 2024, Exploring 12 Premium Cameras for Professional Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-journey-through-joint-video-viewing-the-youtube-way/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Journey Through Joint Video Viewing  The Youtube Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/xploring-the-monetization-framework-of-tseries-via-youtube/"><u>[New] Exploring the Monetization Framework of TSeries via YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/lip-weaver-workshop/"><u>[New] Clip Weaver Workshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-streamlined-steps-to-delete-youtube-discussions-fast/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamlined Steps to Delete YouTube Discussions Fast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-quick-guide-youtube-videos-for-your-instagram-story-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Quick Guide  YouTube Videos for Your Instagram Story for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-diy-youtube-openers-technique-one-and-technique-two/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  DIY YouTube Openers  Technique One & Technique Two</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/nary-filmmaker-blending-clips-and-chords/"><u>Visionary Filmmaker  Blending Clips & Chords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-how-to-buy-youtube-views-everything-you-need-to-know/"><u>[Updated] How to Buy YouTube Views - Everything You Need To Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-building-buzz-strategies-for-shaping-your-unique-youtubing-image/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Building Buzz  Strategies for Shaping Your Unique YouTubing Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-streamline-your-media-experience-add-subtitles-in-windows-media-player/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Media Experience  Add Subtitles in Windows Media Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-tecno-spark-20-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Tecno Spark 20 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-8-best-cinematic-sound-effects-pack-included/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved 8 Best Cinematic Sound Effects Pack Included</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-binge-worthy-viral-video-roundup-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Binge-Worthy  Viral Video Roundup on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-guide-to-the-most-effective-youtube-marketing-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Guide to the Most Effective Youtube Marketing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-a-poco-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Reset a Poco Phone that is Locked?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-precision-in-photos-iphone-apps-for-accurate-cropping/"><u>[Updated] Precision in Photos  IPhone Apps for Accurate Cropping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twit-favorites-of-the-year-amazon-primes-peak-series/"><u>2024 Approved  Twit-Favorites of the Year  Amazon Prime's Peak Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-masters-in-virtual-enclosure-devices/"><u>In 2024, Masters in Virtual Enclosure Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-transitioning-from-standard-to-custom-thumbnails-in-twitter-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Transitioning From Standard to Custom Thumbnails in Twitter Videos for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

When you visit YouTube after installing TubeBuddy a whole new set of useful tools becomes available.</p><p>TubeBuddy’s tools were designed to save you time and effort when performing some of the more mundane tasks involved in running a YouTube channel, like adding cards. Many of TubeBuddy’s tools are completely free to use, but others might require a paid license. There are three levels of licensing: $9, $19, or $39 per month.</p><h4 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube"></a>The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube</h4><ol><li><a href="#productivity"><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bulk"><strong>Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></a></li><li><a href="#tags"><strong>Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#data"><strong>Useful Data</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Benefits-of-TubeBuddy"><a href="#Benefits-of-TubeBuddy" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of TubeBuddy"></a><strong>Benefits of TubeBuddy</strong></h2><p>YouTubers who use TubeBuddy are able to spend less time on busy-work and more time on coming up with creative video ideas. Here are some of the ways TubeBuddy can help you, especially if you have a large or mid-sized channel:</p><h4 id="1-Increased-Productivity"><a href="#1-Increased-Productivity" class="headerlink" title="1. Increased Productivity"></a><strong>1. Increased Productivity</strong></h4><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s Productivity Tools are available for free, but some require a $9 per month Pro license.</p><p>You can use these tools to get your videos ready for posting faster, embed them off-YouTube more easily, and save time by creating canned responses or templates for cards and annotations.</p><p>For example, you might find yourself creating the same YouTube Card over and over again to include it in every video you make. Creating a template through TubeBuddy will save you this effort.</p><p>Another great productivity tool is the Video Topic Planner. You can save video ideas you come up with, or ideas viewers have suggested to you, and arrange them in a queue so you never forget what you are planning to make next.</p><h4 id="2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More"><a href="#2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More" class="headerlink" title="2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More"></a><strong>2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></h4><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubebuddy-bulk-tools.jpg"                      alt="TubeBuddy bulk tools"                ></strong></p><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s bulk processing tools require a $19 per month Star license.</p><p>Two of the most time-saving tools in this section are the Bulk Copy tools for cards and annotations. They will save you from having to recreate the same ones over and over. Then, using the Bulk Update tools, you will be able to make changes to all of your cards or annotations at once.</p><p>For example: if you use a YouTube Card to link to your personal website and include it in every video, and then you change your website, you change the link in all of your existing cards at once.</p><p>Another useful Bulk tool is Bulk Thumbnail Overlays, which will allow you to add a logo to all of your existing video thumbnails at once.</p><h4 id="3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags"><a href="#3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags"></a><strong>3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></h4><p>The SEO Tools in TubeBuddy will help you find the best tags for your videos and suggest tags you might want to target. Many of these tools are free, but others require a $19 Star license.</p><p>One of the best free tools in this category is View and Copy Video Tags. It allows you to see and copy the tags of other people’s videos. You will be able to see which keywords your competitors are targeting (and look for opportunities to target them more effectively). This can also save you a lot of time writing out tags that should really be the same as the ones on an existing video.</p><h4 id="4-Useful-Data"><a href="#4-Useful-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Useful Data"></a><strong>4. Useful Data</strong></h4><p>The most useful piece of data under Data and Research Tools is the Best Time to Publish.

Ideally, YouTube has recently come up with the Shorts feature to focus on short-length videos (and to rival Instagram Reels and TikTok).</p><p>You can now find the Shorts icon at the bottom panel on the YouTube app. Using it, you can watch or record short videos on YouTube easily. These are short-form clips of 60 seconds or less that you can create via the Shorts interface of the YouTube app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-1.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>The interface would let you record multiple videos at different intervals and add sound to your clips as well.

To record anything, you can just tap and hold the red button (the recording icon) on the interface.</p><p>As you would release it, the recording would be stopped. In this way, you can seamlessly move from one scene to another without worrying about editing in post-production.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Stick-to-a-Selective-Niche"><a href="#Tip-2-Stick-to-a-Selective-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Stick to a Selective Niche"></a>Tip 2: Stick to a Selective Niche</h3><p>To have a consistent growth of audience on YouTube shorts, you should stick to a specific niche. If you search on YouTube, you can find short videos related to funny, inspirational, fitness, romantic, and all kinds of niches.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-3.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Most of the prominent content creators already apply these <strong>YouTube Shorts tips</strong> in which they first identify their target audience.

Therefore, you must implement these <strong>tips for</strong> <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> to make the most of this free feature of the app.</p><p>After recording your videos, you can tap on the “Sound” or the “Add Music” feature from the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Now, YouTube will automatically load all kinds of trending music that you can use for free. If you want, you can enter the name of any song on the search option of YouTube shorts.</p><p>As you would select a track, it will automatically be loaded as the background music for your video. Though, you can also select a specific segment of the track and clip it accordingly to place it on your videos the way you like.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Insert-Captions-and-Text-Effects-on-Your-Shorts"><a href="#Tip-4-Insert-Captions-and-Text-Effects-on-Your-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Insert Captions and Text Effects on Your Shorts"></a>Tip 4: Insert Captions and Text Effects on Your Shorts</h3><p>Apart from music, you can also add all kinds of text effects to make your YouTube Shorts videos appealing.

In these <strong>YouTube Shorts tricks</strong>, I would recommend adjusting the playback speed of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-6.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>After recording the video, you can tap on the speed icon from the bottom&#x2F;side panel. Here, you can make your videos play in slow motion or fast forward (in a range of 0.3x to 3x). This will add seamless speed control features to your videos without any technical issues.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Consider-the-Overall-Length-of-Your-Shorts-Video"><a href="#Tip-6-Consider-the-Overall-Length-of-Your-Shorts-Video" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Consider the Overall Length of Your Shorts Video"></a>Tip 6: Consider the Overall Length of Your Shorts Video</h3><p>Even though the maximum length of the YouTube Shorts videos is 60 seconds, you don’t have to make it so long. If you look at most of the popular videos on YouTube Shorts, then you will find that they are of less than 30 seconds in length.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-7.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Remember, your goal is to come up with crisp and interesting content via YouTube Shorts.

Therefore, if you want to implement these <strong>YouTube Shorts tips and tricks</strong>, then consider using the timer feature of the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-8.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Before shooting the video, you can tap on the timer button from the bottom and set up a preferred duration for it (like 10 or 15 seconds). In this way, you can be sure that you won’t go overboard and keep your videos short automatically.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Set-a-Preferred-Target-Audience-for-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Tip-8-Set-a-Preferred-Target-Audience-for-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Set a Preferred Target Audience for YouTube Shorts"></a>Tip 8: Set a Preferred Target Audience for YouTube Shorts</h3><p>Great! Now when you have recorded and edited your video by applying these <strong>tips for YouTube Shorts</strong>, you are ready to post them. While posting your videos, you would be asked whether the video is targeted at kids or not. If the video is made for kids, then you should select the relevant prompt, as YouTube would improve the overall visibility of your videos in this case.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-9.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Though, if your videos are targeted at adults, then you should go with the second option instead. This would help you reach out to your target audience on YouTube easily.</p><h3 id="Tip-9-Post-Your-YouTube-Shorts-the-Right-Way"><a href="#Tip-9-Post-Your-YouTube-Shorts-the-Right-Way" class="headerlink" title="Tip 9: Post Your YouTube Shorts the Right Way"></a>Tip 9: Post Your YouTube Shorts the Right Way</h3><p>Apart from setting the audience preferences of your YouTube Shorts videos, you should also take care of a couple of other things. For instance, you can consider making the visibility of your final video “Public” so that anyone on YouTube can watch it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-10.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Besides that, it is also recommended to have the keyword “#Shorts” in the title of the video. You can also make the title of the video attractive and can even add a short description that would make your audience click on your YouTube video for sure.</p><h3 id="Tip-10-Promote-Your-YouTube-Shorts-Video-on-Other-Places"><a href="#Tip-10-Promote-Your-YouTube-Shorts-Video-on-Other-Places" class="headerlink" title="Tip 10: Promote Your YouTube Shorts Video on Other Places"></a>Tip 10: Promote Your YouTube Shorts Video on Other Places</h3><p>Lastly, posting the YouTube Shorts video is not enough, as you should also promote it to get more views. One of the best <strong>YouTube Shorts tips</strong> for promotion would be posting the snippet of the video as your Stories on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-11.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>You can also post your YouTube Shorts on other popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. by sharing their link. In this way, you can easily redirect your audience from other platforms and increase the visibility of your video.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-Use-a-Professional-Editor-for-Your-YouTube-Shorts-Videos"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Use-a-Professional-Editor-for-Your-YouTube-Shorts-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Use a Professional Editor for Your YouTube Shorts Videos"></a>Bonus Tip: Use a Professional Editor for Your YouTube Shorts Videos</h3><p>As you can see after going through these <strong>YouTube Shorts tricks</strong> that the native tool of the app has limited editing options.
