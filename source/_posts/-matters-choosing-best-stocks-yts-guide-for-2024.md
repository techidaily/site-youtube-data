He advocates more long-term investments and because he's located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He's very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members.

### 3. Young And Investing

With more than 7 million views since the creation of the channel in April 2017, Young And Investing have one of the biggest following in this area.
