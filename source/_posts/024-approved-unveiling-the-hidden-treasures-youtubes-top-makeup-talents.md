## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Makeup Video?

We assume all this must have stimulated the hidden desire in you to film your first makeup video. There's nothing to get nervous about when you have expert tips on how to shoot a perfect makeup tutorial:

1. Make sure you sit facing a window from where the sun is shining through so that it provides a soft natural glow to your face.
2. Ensure there's a continuous stream of light, which hardly flickers or distorts. Set up a ring light to mimic the natural light.
3. To justify the colors of your work and make them pop on your skin, surround yourself with LED luminosity attached with reflectors to disperse the rays evenly throughout the room. This shall keep away the shadows from swallowing you.
4. Assure quality audio by upgrading to camera mics or simply switch to a reliable audio software for getting the work done.
5. Edit out the awkward moments from the shoot, add interesting transitions and effects by narrowing down to a reliable video editing software. Filmora can be a wonderful tool to fine-tune your video, add endless effects, remove background noise (if any) and provide you with full 4K support. And the best thing about it is that it's free for beginners!
