#### 1. ** VidCon

**VidCon US:** June (Anaheim, California)

**VidCon Europe (Amsterdam):** March/April

**VidCon Australia:** August/September

![VidCon-On-Spot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/VidCon-On-Spot.jpg)

In 2017 over 30,000 YouTube enthusiasts – from fans to A-list creators – attended VidCon US, and that was thousands of more people than attended in 2016\. It’s hard to imagine that this event – the biggest convention for YouTube and online video – will do anything but grow over the next few years.

VidCon was founded by the Vlogbrothers in 2010 as a place for internet friends to meet in real life.

**Passes:**

There are three different types of passes for VidCon – the Community Track, the Creator Track, and the Industry Track.

The **Community Track** is for anyone who loves YouTube and wants a chance to see their favorite creators and meet other fans. Pricing ranges from $100 to $180, depending on how early you buy your ticket.

The **Creator Track** gets you to access to all the same events as the Community badges (except for the Meet & Greet Lottery\*), plus even more panels and workshops that will help you become a better creator. Pricing ranges from $150 to $250 depending on how early you buy your ticket.

The **Industry Track** is for anyone working in online video or video-adjacent industries, like advertising, branding, or talent management. There are panels on online marketing and working with influencers. Pricing ranges from $550 to $850, depending on when you buy your ticket.

 \*The Meet and Greet Lottery is a chance for anyone attending with a Community or Industry pass to meet their favorite creator. You rank the 15 creators you’d most like to meet according to how much you want to meet them. A computerized system will determine who gets into which Meet & Greet.

You have a two-week window (usually the first half of May) to submit your choices.

#### 2. ** PlayList Live

**Orlando, Florida:** April/May

**Tri-State (Secaucus, New Jersey):** September

Playlist Live prides itself on having ‘non-stop interactive activities.’ These include chances to meet your favorite creators on the Saturday and Sunday of the event. Which meetups you get to attend are determined by first-come-first-serve online signup.

The **Parent Pass/Parent + Merch/Parent Deluxe** ($75-$200) is for parents who want to chaperone their kids around Playlist Live and includes access to everything the Standard Pass can access.

The **Insight Pass** ($150-$205) is for anyone who wants to learn more about being a digital creator. You get Standard access as well as workshops and panels for successful creators and industry professionals designed to help you on your path.
