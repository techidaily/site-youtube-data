### 2\. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live

To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel's YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:

Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the "Profile" icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the "YouTube Studio" option.

![choose the youtube studio option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg)

Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen. From the left panel, select "Content" among other options. Under the section called "Live," locate the "Get Started" option. Afterward, tap on the "Request" option and perform the verification steps for enabling live streaming. After 24 hours, you would get approval for live streaming on YouTube.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet

Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.

Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the **Google Meet live stream** on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.

## Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube

Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube. Check the following steps to execute the process:

Step2 Afterward, click "Google Meet" and tap on the "Stream" option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options "Let People Steam Their Meetings" and "Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings." Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.

Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.

Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select "Live Streaming." Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.

Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the "Start" button. You can see the red "Live" button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the "Stop Streaming" button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.
