![techno gamerz income export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-8.jpg)

Your YouTube gaming tutorial also needs subtitles to stand out from the crowd. Select the YouTube video clip and click the **Speech-to-Text** button. Once the Speech-to-Text feature is active, select the translation language to start creating subtitles. Remember, you can edit and download the subtitle tracks as a .txt or .srt file.

##### Step4 Convert the video and upload it on YouTube

If you're satisfied with the edited video, click the **Export** button, then select MP4, WebM, or MP4 AV1 as the target format. Now name your video, choose a folder path, and export it. Remember that you can also directly upload videos on YouTube by clicking the **YouTube** tab.
