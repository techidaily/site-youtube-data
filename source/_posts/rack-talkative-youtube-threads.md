## **Part 2:** **How to Find the First Comments You Have Posted on YouTube?**

There are times when you regret what you've commented on in the past or wish to go back and look up your first message on YouTube. However, it is not always possible to recall the channel or video where you left the comment.

So, is there a way or a tool that can make it just a doodle? Certainly yes. Did you know that you can check for any previous comments you've made on YouTube regardless of how old it is?

Everything you have to do now follows the steps below. For the following methods, it is preferable to use a browser rather than the YouTube App.

* Go to the homepage of YouTube. At the top left corner, Click on the three-lined icon. Click on History next. You will be redirected to your account's history section.
* At the right corner, choose History type as 'community.' Below that, click on the 'Comments' option. Finally, a new tab would open with all your YouTube comment history.

By these basic steps, enjoy editing or deleting your comments and replies directly on YouTube!

However, you will have to scroll down a long way before you hit the end to see your first comment posted on YouTube.

## Part 3: How to Find the Latest Comments you have received on YouTube?

You do not get notifications about comments left on your YouTube videos at times. Mostly, it's due to your notification preferences. When you enable comment notifications, you'll be informed of all the latest comments on your videos. And this, in turn, allows you to keep track of your followers and engage with them more easily.

YouTube is a vast platform, and there are quite a few modifications hidden everywhere. To know everything is not always possible. Now that you are here let's see how to locate the most recent comment you've got on YouTube.

**Step 1: Enable Comment Notifications**

* Open the homepage of YouTube, scroll down to 'Settings' and click on it. You will be redirected to the Setting page.
* From the bar in the left corner, select **Notifications** and scroll down and enable 'Activity on my Channel.'

These steps are convenient both for pc as well as a mobile app. Just follow three steps, Setting-Notifications-Activity on your Channel.

**Step 2: Check the Notification Bar**

* Click on the bell icon at the top right corner and there you would receive notifications regarding all the comment activities. Click on the particular notification to go to that comment.

## Bonus: How to Change the Comments View Order?

Did you know you can also customize your comment section as per your need? On the watch page for your video, you can rearrange the order of the comments. You may sort the comments by top comments or by date added. It's just simple steps ahead.

* First of all, you need to sign in to YouTube Studio: <http://studio.youtube.com>,
* From the left bar, select Content, click a video's thumbnail, and click on Show More in video details page.

**Conclusion**

YouTube comments play a predominant role in handling your business as a YouTuber. It's reasonable to believe that the search algorithm considers comments on your videos to be a significant indicator of their efficiency, and therefore gives them higher rankings for specific searches.

The higher your video content's exposure on the internet, the more you'll be included in YouTube or Google searches.

YouTube Comments Finder helps you keep track of the good and bad comments in your videos and definitely helps improve the SEO of your Channel. Thanks to YouTube's advanced tools and websites like Hadzy, YouTube comment Finder, YT Comment Finder and YouTube First Comment Finder, managing third-party interaction is a lot simpler today.
