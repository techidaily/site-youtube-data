![screen recorder vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-VLC.JPG)

VLC Media Player is a free media player that has a great screen recording feature. You can download it from Video LAN.org. In order to take a screen recording using VLC you first need to click on View and Advanced Controls. A lot of the more advanced features, like screen recording, are initially hidden so as not to confuse users, but selecting Advanced Controls will make them visible. Then you can go to Media and Open Capture Device. In the window that opens choose Desktop next to Capture Mode and click Play. VLC will start displaying your desktop in the player window. Now you just have to click Record.

QuickTime is the default media player for Mac users. To access QuickTime’s screen recording feature select File and New Screen Recording. In the window that pops up click on the arrow next to the Record button and choose a microphone. Then you can press Record. Your recording will not start right away. First, a window will pop up explaining that you can stop your recording by pressing ‘command-control-escape’. Although QuickTime is available for PCs the PC version does not have a screen recording feature.
